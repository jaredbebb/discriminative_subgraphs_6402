family am well liked and have many lifetime friends as i am loyal

multi-relationship taskers need not apply and sorry - no newly
divorced daters. i'm that 18 years married 6 years single kind of

comfortable nets we'll easily land each other. we have our freinds
and family and lives we come with- but know we balance out best
with love and support towards healthwealth and happiness.<br />
people often ask me if i prefer mike or michael. ok; i like hearing
mike from someone that cares and we're having fun which should be
often. i'm known as michael in my business - and calling me by full
name is a magic way to keep my full attention-<br />

above was my first cut at doing this and i have been informed that
i may not have grasped the concept. droning on and on just isn't my
style so maybe that makes me a good listener. i do listen very
well and believe that words have meaning so i take what is said as
what is meant. probably makes me overly sensitive when discussing
certain topics such as feelings between me and my partner. i like
to kid around and can laugh at myself so that type of verbal

title: king missle - cheesecake truck lyrics<br />
so then i got this idea about driving a cheesecake truck<br />
'cause i figured at the end of the day<br />
i could take some of the leftover cheesecakes home<br />
and i love cheesecake<br />
so i went to the cheesecake company<br />
and they asked me if i could drive a truck<br />
and i said ""yes""<br />
and they said ""you're hired!""<br />
so the next day i got in the truck with all the cheesecakes<br />
and i drove about a block and i just had to have a cheesecake<br />
so i pulled over and opened the truck<br />
and i got a cheesecake<br />
and i also took another one for later<br />
and i took one to bring home<br />
and i took one for my friend farm boy<br />
and by that time i had<br />
eaten one of the cheesecakes so i took another one<br />
then i figured i might as well stop at my house<br />
to drop off all the cheesecakes<br />
so i take five cakes to eat on the way<br />
and i drive another block and a half to my house<br />
now it's lunchtime so i eat ten cheesecakes<br />
and a cheesecake for desert<br />
i should point out by the way<br />
that all of these cheesecakes were very delicious<br />
anyway i decided that the only thing to do<br />
would be to eat all the rest of the cheesecakes<br />
and hide the truck somewhere<br />
and leave town<br />
and i miss everybody a lot<br />
but i'm not really sorry<br />
'cause they were very delicious cheesecakes",100000

are you dreaming of that exciting passion filled relationship you
always wanted?<br />
have your past dating experiences been as exciting as dating archie
bunker?<br />
wanting a man that will communicate with you during your day so
that you feel wanted liked adored?<br />
sick of being bored with a guy that just watches tv and sports all
day and night?<br />
do you want someone that actually stays awake after sex that
cuddles and talks to you with lots of giggling?!<br />
someone you can count on when things are rough in life?<br />
someone loyal as a canine?<br />
passionate as a greek god?<br />
well read on as your search may finally be over!!<br />
<br />
i think what best characterizes me is that i am well balanced in
my attitudes towards life. i can be serious and responsible when
the time calls for it and other times i can be more wild
spontaneous and very funny. i can be a father-like figure more
conservative a handy-man and at the same time i can cook and be
more in touch with my feminine side ( sounds goofy i know). i can
be boyish and playful and then i can be totally masculine and
sensual. yes i know that sounds funny for a man but i am very
sensual.<br />
<br />
also family means everything to me and i try to be gratefully
everyday for all that has been given to me in this life. simple
solution for happiness everyday is to count our blessings.<br />
<br />
passions:<br />
<br />
my passions are playing guitar which i have been doing for over 25
years. i have the need to express myself in a passionate way so
that is why i love music and playing an instrument.<br />
<br />
i love cooking good food good spirits and sometimes just hanging
out and watching a great movie.<br />
you know laying in bed and talking about everything and anything
and lots of giggling in between.<br />
btw i am not the type of man to lay in bed and go to sleep right
away and start snoring. lol its true.<br />
<br />
i am a very very giving person. i love cooking a romantic dinner
for my companion and keeping her surprised and happy. when i see my
significant other happy it contributes a lot to my own
happiness.<br />
also i am not photogenic at all. every woman i have met has said
that i look better than my pictures on my profile.<br />
<br />
the best part? i have a personality. recently i had someone on
match actually after being ""entertained by my goofiness from
messaging"" tell me i am too good to be true! lol hmmmmmm maybe i
can put that in a testimonials part?? lol<br />
<br />
oh well...<br />
<br />
does that sound like an inflated ego?<br />
<br />
told you its tough to do this!<br />
<br />
what i am looking for:<br />
<br />
i am looking for my equal.<br />
life is sometimes tough and it makes the good times even
better<br />
love is a two way street that takes dedication and devotion<br />
my profile is 100% real and i expect for a woman's to be as
well<br />
i have only love devotion and hard work to offer<br />
<br />
in the end it is about finding that certain someone that makes you
feel like you are a better person. makes you feel special. someone
that makes you feel like coming ""home"". yes i would like a lot of
different traits in a woman but if i feel that ""certain something""
the rest is fine. but i also believe that relationships have
periods of hard work and sacrifice. anything worth anything needs
self sacrifice. that is what love is to me<br />
<br />
to the really attractive women out there that get tons of mails per
day and haven't found their man. change your approach already! read
the average joes profiles! remember that the george clooneys of the
world became attractive because of their characters.<br />

i'm from several places. ny fl &amp; dc. i was produced &amp; born
in ny (long island). my father grew up in the city. hearing his

my grandparents moved south retirement: fl &amp; my parents
followed bringing me &amp; my brother for us to get to know our
grandparents they passed 3-4 years later. instead of moving back to
civilization my family remained in fl.<br />
<br />
primary years i attended a private catholic school. it was a great
education but the nuns were insane. the nuns tortured me &amp; i
found new ways to drive them crazy. it was as mutual agreement that
i needed to leave after 6th grade. you need to know this as i may
have a mini panic attack if too many nuns hop on the elevator w/ me
(you will need to wrap your strong arms around me for protection).
also i tend to be rebellious or overly sarcastic when there are
rigid illogical rules in place (singapore comes to mind but i
didn't bring any gum).<br />
<br />
for undergrad i went to ucf for business. in 2000 after
graduation the economy sucked so i decided to go straight into
grad school for my mba at fsu. you need to know that the seminoles
(not gators) are my team &amp; i may be ornery for a few minutes if
we don't win vs. gators or canes.<br />
<br />
2 days after graduation the u-haul was packed &amp; headed to the
dc area. i worked &amp; lived there for 5 years. the seasons were
great! however this was way too far inland and the people there
drove me nuts (it was during the w era). i could never get away
from politics which would not be bad if it was actually a
conversation. to counter the fox news that surrounded me i got my
news from the daily show &amp; colbert report. the siren of sf was
calling my name. but first i had to quit my job to travel for a
year through se asia and s india.<br />

i'm a swm living in the east bay (berkeley area). i'm looking to
meet a woman in the east bay area for the usual type of things:
movies dinners bike rides and just hanging out.<br />
<br />
i was born in manhattan lived in brooklyn for 18 months (so i'm
told) but grew up in central new jersey (exit 7a). i came to the
bay area in 1990 (via college in pittsburgh pa) and have a group
of close friends in the area that are heavily involved in my life.
we get together often but as people settle down it seems harder
and harder to find someone to do things with! so ideally i'd like
to meet someone who has enough flexibility in their life that they
could go away for a weekend once in a while or take a 2-3 week
vacation once a year and do some traveling. i have a good job (the
same one for 20+ yrs!) and i get a lot of vacation time and i
would like to start using it to travel the world more.",100000

i am seeking a woman who still likes to play and engage in a
carefree enjoyment of life. indeed it would be refreshing to find
a woman that laughs out loud in public or a movie theater who can
skip down a set of stairs with me run along the beach in her bare
feet and so on. :)<br />
<br />
granted i am not rugged-looking but at heart i am a gentleman and
a rogue. i will value and devour you...why? because i want a deep
connection with you...every single day i want to brush the hair
from your eyes and kiss you like it is the first time and could be
the last time. i want to walk by your side hold your hand look
into your eyes talk about whatever and kiss your lips. i want to
make out with you in the pouring rain. i want to call you when i am
away. i want to make you laugh when you are sad. i want to be your
best friend and lover and never break your heart. i want to hold
you in my arms forever.<br />
<br />
i am a man who relishes the cultural riches and natural beauty of
the bay area. i approach life with childlike wonder and curiosity
about the depths and nuances that make life rich. i am equally at
home in urban settings or wilderness enjoying art theater film
live music dancing and cafes as well as hiking beaches at
sunset the nooks and crannies of the bay area and cozy evenings at
home.<br />
<br />
i am also casual non-materialistic low-key and easy-going: a
laid-back man who can dress up when required. i am not a pollyanna
but i love sunshine flowers nature romance happy endings
couples falling in love children and so on.<br />
<br />
i am willing to try new and different things. for example a friend
took me to an improve comedy class in december. among other things
i pretended to be a dancing ballerina. :)<br />
<br />
i am often spontaneous as well. for example this summer i was
having lunch with woman friend at the embarcadero where there was
zipline setup for the day. despite my fear of heights i rode the
zipline and i laughed all the way down the line.<br />
<br />
my personality<br />
i am not like other men. i am an enfj ""the giver""...enfj's main
interest in life is giving love and support. naturally i enjoy
heartfelt emotional intimacy with a woman that i love. i am also
emotionally giving and love to give and receive affection.<br />
<br />
moreover i am a gentleman who enjoys making a woman feel feminine
and valued. i also try to find the good in things and have a great
night out even if everything is not perfect. a night starting with
a romantic french dinner and a planned art gallery opening can end
instead with us swing dancing to a hot blues band.<br />
<br />
i tend to do well with women who are psychologically aware and
thoughtful. i also seem to get along better with women who read
and/or write poetry...and oh yeah i am romantic. so if a woman
isn't romantic we won't get along.<br />
<br />
i am also secure in my sexuality and lgbt friendly.<br />

it's typical for me to get lost in the details of the world around
me: the timbre of a noise or the albedo of a surface or the texture

<br />
i am in love with sf and everything that this city has to offer! i
moved up here for my job from la originally from san diego and
had no idea how much i would love it here.there is always something
to do and something going on. i love going to all the festivals
parks doing anything and everything outdoors. l am very
spontaneous love good restaurants( which there are a ton here!)
and i take every minute that i can to explore this amazing
city!<br />
<br />
i love traveling( i travel alot for work and always extend my trips
by tagging on vacations). but i grew up on the beach so i favor
any place tropical or with some sort of body of water! i value
natures beauty over everything.<br />
<br />
i like to live a very balanced life. i work hard at work and take
every minute while not at work to live my life to the fullest. i am
very chill and go-with-the flow and like being around people who
are the same way. i'm not into high strung people or people that
have to plan everything up to the t in life life is about
experiencing it for all that it has to offer some of the best
experiences come when something out of the plan happens . and when
something happens out of the ordinaryeven if it's bad that is
when you laugh the hardest and have the best stories to
tell!<br />

it]<br />

clear vision of the future a plan becomes possible so i'm not
just relying on raw talent due diligence and luck to get through
life.<br />

i am now and sharing that future with a life-long partner. in old
age i'll have children that surpass me. eg: if i become a
director my children will be ceos of fortune 500 companies... ok

she has strong personality and character like someone from a

necessary. she can be just a little crazy at times but not insane.
she is adventurous...willing to try new things for a taste of
adrenaline. she enjoys shopping and taking care of herself so she
dresses and smells better than i do. she goes out and knows how to
party. places like concerts football games car shows race
tracks music festivals and dance clubs don't scare her. she likes
spontaneous travel even if its just for a weekend in tahoe or an
entire week in europe. she eats meat (e.g. beef chicken fish).
she is able to hang with the boys and is part of the crew not part
of the cargo. she can be goofy or silly because she who laughs
last thinks slowest. she welcomes animals...emphasis on the ""s""
because only one gets lonely. she doesn't work for life but her
life is her work.",100000

background. oh and i love knowing glances from across the room
and consistently wear my contacts so as not miss them.<br />
<br />
i am a girly-girl but love a good fight in a hockey game. *that
said* i am not the camping or fishing type. just thought you should
know in the event that's a deal killer.<br />

i love to laugh and not take it all so seriously so i'm a sucker
for someone with a great sense of humor! (actually it's sexy...)
dry sarcastic as long as it's humor.<br />

to host dinner parties. to be clear  i can cook i simply opt out

random facts<br />
- i can strike up and have an interesting conversation with just
about anyone. (just ask a random stranger)<br />
- i'm good at fixing things. really.<br />
- chivalry makes me swoon.<br />
- i love zihuatenejo. i go almost every year.<br />

- i have small hands.<br />
- i grew up riding horses competitively.<br />
- my middle name is one letter. really.<br />

we could be compatible if<br />
you love to laugh (at me with me at yourself etc.). you can
carry a conversation about more than football or baseball (though i
love watching sports - i just prefer the topic doesn't dominate all
conversations). you like dumb comedies or won't think i'm a fool
for laughing until i cry while watching one.<br />
<br />
you think chemistry is deeper than skin-level and you don't have a
long unrealistic laundry list of things that must be present. you
look forward to expanding the circle of people you know (at least
by one).<br />
<br />
you carry a bit of baggage (who doesn't) but you've moved beyond
any bitterness about your ex.<br />
<br />
you're compassionate (watching ""the last lecture"" moved you as did
the ""where the hell is matt?"" videos)<br />
<br />
oh and you like paris. or you'd like to see if you like it. (to
clarify the one in france not texas not hilton)<br />

we may not be compatible if<br />
if you linger in the gray area and still want to ""taste all 31
flavors"" are in this for the thrill of the hunt are looking for a
friend with benefits young enough to be my son or old enough to
be my father (though i'm flattered) ... we may not be a
match.<br />

relationships  i am not that girl  we are definitely not a

"actually i have another profile on here but created this one b/c

have a problem meeting women in person and usually when a girl i
find attractive gets to know me they eventually end up making a
pass at me.. i'm good looking athletic intelligent and quite
successful at what i do but for some reason it is ridiculously
difficult to meet a single attractive intelligent female in this
damn city.. i leave sf and have to fight off girls in la ny
europe south america.. etc...<br />
why i ask myself and my friends constantly? almost everywhere in sf
is a sausage fest.. you'd think a city with such a high gay
population would actually have a better ratio for straight males
but that just isn't the case- most of the bar scenes are filled
with the same overly aggressive douche bag guys who have no
originality and all dress the same.. furthermore most girls in this
city think they are way better looking than they are- in other
cities and countries most of you who think you're 8's are actually
6's- so i guess i'm kind of bitter and here to say- get over
yourselves and stop being so damn flaky and picky!! i don't need to
be on here b/c as i said before i have no problem attracting women
in person but you all act like the pickiest crop of females on the
planet for no reason... i'm on the verge of being an
internationally recognized and very well off musician but i have a
hard time meeting girls when i'm out b/c i am always performing and
when i'm done everyone has usually vacated the premises.. that is
the only reason i'm on here but i'm seriously over it.. so again
ladies- get over yourselves- most of you are not that hot.. i was
against online dating for years and only came on here b/c a friend
urged me to- and i figured what the heck- it's just another way to
meet someone i probably won't meet in some overly crowded bar
filled with 10 douche bag dudes to every 2 cute girls... i guess
i'm back to that or maybe moving to another city where girls
actually like being approached by an attractive male they don't
know...<br />
oh.. and if you actually want to converse with me i'd be more than
happy to send you a pic or multiple current pics of me and what i
look like.. i don't think you'd be disappointed.. unless you're

my background:<br />
i'm puerto rican with some cuban thrown in for good measure. i was
raised in pr moved back to the mainland for high school. i
attended the u.s. military academy at west point. in my
semi-nomadic lifestyle in my 20's i lived in boston denver san
francisco (1st time) la san diego san jose and now back to sf.
i live in mission bay two blocks from at&amp;t park. it's a great
location...quiet lots of things to do convenient to
transit...pretty much the perfect location in sf.<br />
<br />
interests/hobbies:<br />
<br />
bodybuilding has been a passion of mine since my days as a cadet. i
really got into it in my 20's to compete; now i do it because i
love it! pushing one's self to physical limits or endurance is a
great feeling. plus who doesn't like looking good? started a new
routine with a new trainer recent (dave kendrick) and he's kicking
my ass!<br />
dogs: i've been raised around dogs since i was born - no kidding.
my dad got a dog about a week after i was born. the breed i was
raised with is the golden retriever; my current little girls are my
4th and 5th goldens in my lifetime. the older one is almost 5 the
puppy is six months old (they are aunt and niece by blood.) the
puppy came home on may 16...check out pictures of her at
http://gallery/me.com/scott.melendez/100071. she's in her tweens
kind of like a teenager going into puberty with big paws she
doesn't quite know how to use yet.<br />
books: i have a voracious appetite for knowledge so books you'd
likely find on my night stand are about current events or history.
i do love fiction but there have only been a few fiction novels
recently that i liked (except anything by stephen king). favorite
books: the lords of discipline dress grey the silmarillion the
stand it.<br />
music: my favorite genres are classic 60's and 70's rock: pink
floyd rolling stones led zeppelin ccr fleetwood mac
aerosmith...you get the picture. i like to listen to dance music
while working out or doing (yuk) cardio. i got into grunge in the
90s...soundgarden nirvana alice in chains etc. and my guilty
pleasures are the stuff from the 80's.<br />
movies: big time movie buff here and summertime popcorn movies
are my favorites. i'm open to seeing just about any film. favorites
are classics like alien aliens the thing silence of the lambs
memento the dark knight jaws. i have a nostalgic place in my
heart for the empire strikes back (since i think it was the first
movie i could see with friends and no parents.)<br />
tv: anything on national geographic or discovery american dad
reno 911! the office law &amp; order 30 rock. i indulge in the
occasional reality show like top chef or flipping out. favorite
new shows: chuck reaper fringe.<br />
other: a friend of mine just me into rugby. i love politically
incorrect comedy  lisa lampanelli chris rock and i am a devoted
howard stern fan. i like taking my dog to different parks the
beach and exploring the city. oh and i am a total techno-geeki
love gadgets and new technology. i worship at the shrine of apple:
2 macbook pros an iphone 3 ipodsi am steve jobs' loyal
minion.<br />
personality (or at least how i'd describe it) and what i want in a
man:<br />
<br />
i'm one of those nice shy guys who has a hard time making the
first move when meeting people; however once the ice is broken
i'm pretty extroverted. i'm generally laid back and i have a good
dry sense of humor. i have somewhat the personality of a golden
retriever...i'm loyal friendly and affectionate...though i don't
slobber (my ex-boyfriend said i do). laid-back doesn't mean i'm not
adventurous...i'll try almost anything. i can be an intellectual
but not the nerdy type. i like to have knowledge of a wide range of
topics. i'm sort of disconnected from the gay ""scene"" but i like
roaming through the castro with my dog on a nice day. (having lived
there for 2 years i was kind of over the novelty of being 2 blocks
away from castro street.)<br />
<br />
i am muscular educated and charming",100000
"ahh... the empty nest. so much freedom but it would be so much
more fun with a companion! i work in san francisco and live across
the bridge in the piedmont ave. area of oakland so i feel i have
the best of both worlds with lots of opportunities to meet people
in both places!<br />
<br />
and what might that ideal companion look like? well i've been
around the block enough to know that this is not the kind of thing
for which i can make a wish list....if i do i'll miss out on the
unexpected serendipitous match! but there are a few things i do
know....<br />
<br />
a sense of humor is hugely important! without that life gets just
too serious. i love to laugh but i'm terrible at remembering the
punchline for jokes... i'll be a wonderful audience for you!<br />
<br />
exploring and traveling is where it's at! whether it's a quick trip
to mendocino or to hawaii mexico or europe life expands
exponentially when i can get outside of my own little world.<br />
<br />
the arts nourish me....i'm still amazed at the cultural experience
that can be had here in the bay area. i love the berkeley rep
theater freight and salvage the curran the orpheum....and the
list goes on. i love live music theater and i'm a movie buff as
well. all great food for thought and a source of
companionship!<br />
<br />
i am a compassionate person and appreciate that quality in others.
having a positive outlook on life seeing the glass as half-full
rather than half-empty is very important to me.<br />
<br />
but when it comes down to it my wish list comes to down to two
things. i think it's all about that magical combination of
companionship and compatibility however it comes about! it doesn't
seem to work if it's only one or the other. i'd love to hear from
you if you think your wish list might match mine!",100000
"allrighty here's the deal! i just moved to the city in february
this year after finishing up grad school on the east coast and boy
am i glad to see the back of those freezing cold winters. i've not
been here for long but already have a huge list of places to visit
and restaurants to try out. i strongly believe in work hard play
hard and always have something fun planned out over the weekends.
umm wot else. no glaring personality disorders no creepy fetishes
or murderous tendencies and i can freakin spell! wow rite? i'm not
a douche i'm honest straightforward chivalrous charming good
looking not a cheater and have a good heart both cardiovascularly
and otherwise :-p. i guess that already makes me a keeper in some
ways. that is if you can get past the sarcastic and overly literal
sense of humor. i like girls who are like cats - very independent
and got their own thing going on love to eat very affectionate in
the mornings and when they need your credit card intelligent and
when they don't like something let you know in your face. just
don't be addicted to catfood coz that makes you a prawn (get the
movie reference here? :-p )",100000
"aloooooha!<br />
<br />
i feel like life is too short to dwell on the negative things.
there's a tendency to constantly focus on how we can do better
when often it's more important to consider all the things that are
going well!<br />
<br />

many different things to do...many of which i probably don't even
know about yet! i have a great relationship with my <a class=

been drunk or something. what are you supposed to write here

there enough words to truly describe what i am? probably not. i'd
like to think that i am intelligent (though with my new job i have
to say that i may not be in the top 99% anymore... maybe 95% :p )
sometimes i'm brave sometimes i am a coward. mostly i am creative
but but there are times when the right expressions don't come to

don't like to think of myself as jaded but truth be told i might

things which were not available way out on the south dakota

engaging man. i have lived and worked with people of many different
backgrounds and walks of life. i hope to make more friends in the
bay area who are closer to my age.... i have been blessed by some
marvelous families who have taken me in as one of their own.

are single too. of course i am also interested in meeting someone

"april 2012: my profile is turning into a long (boring) blog. final
update! i now own my own little piece of downtown oakland and am
calling the east bay home again. this is going to be an amazing
summer.<br />
<br />
december 2011 update: breaking news! i suck at dating! well that's
not totally accurate - i just feel like i'm supposed to be playing
a game where nobody will take the time to explain the rules. having
said that the more time i spend with women (and the more okcupid
horror stories i'm told) the more convinced i am of my own status
as a mega-lotto jackpot of potential partners.<br />
<br />
i was a bit discouraged recently about what i was (or wasn't)
getting out of dating but someone made a very interesting point to
me - that the returns from dating aren't regular or incremental.
the proper approach is to keep at it because you never know how
close you are to actually hitting the jackpot - and all those
mediocre dates you went on until you did hit the jackpot won't be
relevant anymore.<br />
<br />
so ladies here i am. let's meet up and get to know each other a
bit. it is a gamble and of course i can't promise you'll win but
the prize is worth the risk.<br />
<br />
=========================================<br />
<br />
life moves pretty fast. some people reinvent themselves all the
time out of their own volition. i reinvent myself because
everything around me changes so much that the old me doesn't seem
to fit anymore.<br />
<br />
i've lived all over the bay area and in a few spots in la (but i
was born in new mexico and grew up in new york).<br />
<br />
i've gone off to college 4 or 5 times and started majors in an
equal number of disciplines (computer science portuguese piano
philosophy). somehow i never managed to wrap it up and get a
degree.<br />
<br />
i've worked a lot of computer nerd gigs. i've been a temp for a
retail chain a back-room jerk-dungeon-dwelling computer mechanic
in a mom &amp; pop shop a tech support peon for a nationwide isp
a corporate trainer paid to ooze bullshit for 8 hours a day and
now i'm an ubernerd sysadmin at a gaming company. for a while i
was sure i'd be a dj but it turns out my talent for self promotion
isn't as strong as my talent for mixing.<br />
<br />
i've been fortunate enough to visit 20 or so countries in my time
on this planet and have spent a few years overseas if you add it
all up.<br />
<br />
i'm a connoisseur and a hedonist but that doesn't mean i lack
gratitude or compassion. i drink deep of wine and of life.<br />
<br />
i love to fall in love. femininity makes my pulse race. when a
woman has caught my interest all it takes is a peek at the hairs
on the nape of her neck or the curve of her collarbone to set my
heart aflutter.<br />
<br />
i'm also old enough to have some perspective. i've been around the
block enough times that i'm able to experience an emotion without
being controlled by it. maybe that sounds dispassionate but i
think it just means i leave myself open to feel things others shy
away from.<br />

i'm on this site because i want to start a new love affair. if you
don't have any passion left in you don't bother with me.",100000
"are you smarter than a 27-year old?<br />
<br />
why do i ask? i am looking for the one thing *all guys* say they
want from smart attractive women they meet: intellectual
stimulation. (smile/wink)<br />
do you believe that?<br />
well in this case -- you can. i seek that dimension and
more.<br />
<br />
who am i?<br />
no one ever refers to me as a typical american guy. if that is what
you seek then i have some great friends to introduce you to. i
have more layers and flavors than your standard american happy meal
-- for those with a taste for discovery adventure imagination
and ... exploration. (very satisfying for the right palette and
less fattening too.)<br />
<br />
so you've got wits and humor. good. travelled and
reasonably-well-read? excellent. our first conversation will
probably arrive fresh with a delightful sprinkling of intrigue
humor and wit. with a little audience participation on your part
it can ease to warmer glows and rich lingering aftertones.<br />
<br />
of course there is *magic* ----- emotional chemistry. the fire
mystery spark electricity ""the juice"" -- that stuff. very
important. either we click or we won't and we'll figure that out
pretty fast.<br />
<br />
if your senses of humor and adventure crave healthy excercise with
the right person give me a shout.<br />
<br />
if curiosity is perking up now you can satisfy it. no need for
anything fancy -- a simple ""hello"" works suprisingly well.<br />

"because stories are better than self-summaries the story of what
my okcupid photo should have been:<br />
<br />
i was in nepal last september - monsoon season - when it rains like
the world is ending almost every afternoon. naturally in a moment
of infinite intelligence i rented a mountain bike one day and rode
pretty far up into the mountains. by 3 p.m. i could see no more
than a few feet in front of me.<br />
<br />
tinpiple village - all two buildings of it - became my refuge and
i stood with the village's ~20 people under their two roofs. we
didn't speak because i don't speak nepalese and they don't speak
english (or spanish). we just stood and watched the monsoon. i
wondered how in the world i was getting home and whether this scene
was real. they wondered whether their home would sustain the
insta-flood and whether the soaking wet dude standing 6 feet tall
with a bright yellow bike and a bright red helmet was real. i now
know what it feels like to be a national geographic photo waiting
to happen.<br />

different at the same time. i don't necessary need a man underfoot
but when he's with me he is my prince and i would do everything to
please him. he's my main focus and nothing else matter. i am
looking for someone who is honest and straight forward. i have
little patience for a person who is a coward and cannot communicate
because of this. mean what you say and say what you mean. people
must know that i'm a person that they can talk too or ask
questions. i get approached by strangers and they want to talk. i'm
a good listener. people don't notice that i'm always thinking. my
mind is constantly going no matter what i'm working on. difficult

"being single in the bay area is no easy task. everyone is so busy
that the only place to meet people is in the gym or safeway. but
who in his right mind would do that? so here i am on a dating
sight. not only am i single but i am also a single dad. i have two
kids girl and boy 12 and 14. i gotta tell you that people my age
are grand parents. so it's doubly difficult for me to find a
partner. i was married for 14 years. the one thing i learned from
my divorce is that every one has the right to pursue their
happiness. even your ex. and so i am looking for my happiness. i
don't need you to co-parent my kids. i am an expert father. i don't
need a wife. what i'd like to find is a partner in life. some one
that will allow her self to be loved and could return the
favor.<br />

post-reproductive dating:<br />
since i have been meeting only divorced women i thought i'd add
this note. this is second time around for me. meaning that i have
been married once before. the marriage satisfied my need to be a
parent. i can change diapers do laundry kiss a boo-boo and read
kids to sleep. it satisfied my need to be a spouse. we shared
property in common we shared bank accounts and credit cards. this
time around is different. it is different because the union
between me and you will not be based on having more kids. we are
not going to share bank accounts credit cards nor are we buying
property in common. the more time passes between the divorce and
now the more clarity one gets on ones life. for this second long
term relationship to work both of us have to be brutally honest and
painfully realistic. you (my potential mate) have to be at least as
far along your journey of emotional development as i am. we are
equals. this is a truly egalitarian relationship. you are
emotionally sable. you are financially self-sufficient. you have
been disabused of the notion that: ""they lived happily ever after"".
you are not going to run away at the first sign of problems but
will give it you best to try and work things out. if you are still
looking for a fairy tale i am not your prince. i am just a man
seeking companionship with a like minded person.<br />

i'm self-aware and curious about the world - i read widely
listen ask questions stay open and love synthesizing new
knowledge and experiences. i grew up more in my head but as an
adult have learned to live in a more balanced way in my heart and
body (and spirit) as well.<br />
<br />
i'm adventurous and independent-minded and have taken risks both
professionally (starting my own biz touring with lollapalooza
making unconventional choices) and in terms of travel and
exploration (i've traveled in west africa visited with stone age
tribes in new guinea rafted in cr trekked the himalayas studied
spanish and art in mexico and lived in paris and london).
traveling to distant lands has brought me some of my greatest joys
and is something i'd love to continue to do with a partner (climb
mt. kilimanjaro anyone?)<br />
<br />
i love to play games (especially logic and language ones--bridge
scrabble crosswords etc). i read pretty voraciously - am an avid
new yorker fan (tho it feels sometimes as if they never stop
coming...) reasonably avid arts fan - music dance visual art
photography and film mostly. studied both film and photography
but decided to pursue other things. last 2 shows i went to were
gillian welch and the punch brothers. both amazing.<br />
<br />
i'm active and fit (exercise 3-4x/wk love to hike and am hoping
to get back to tennis when my tennis elbow heals). exercise is a
really important part of my life. i am loving the fall colors and
go walking or jogging in the arboretum here as often as i possibly
can. i finally got certified for scuba but it has been a couple of
years sadly since i've gone. i love staring at beautiful fish
and swimming with them.<br />
<br />
i'm trying to create a steady meditation practice stumbling often
and trying to avoid the second arrow ;-).<br />
<br />
i cook a lot and enjoy a good bottle of wine (and some bad ones
for that matter). i've eaten at some of best restaurants in the
world and love a great meal but i love a good burger about as
much.<br />
<br />
i'm very close to my family and a wide long-standing circle of
friends. i have lots of kids in my life and had the great good
fortune thanks to my two best friends to witness 3 births. i have
considered adopting but am on the fence. all that is to say that i
love kids and have lots of experience with them and am open to
having more of them in my life. i've been so deeply involved in my
work that i haven't been as focused as i am now on a long-term
relationship. i'd love to find a life partner but would also enjoy
meeting great people along the way and exploring this new
city.<br />
<br />
i moved to seattle a few months ago for a job in education/
philanthropy and am enjoying getting to know the area. i don't
know how long exactly i'll be here. the same can be said for life
right?<br />
<br />
probably the one thing that you'd experience with me that i
haven't successfully conveyed is my sense of humor: i'm playful
silly and witty/sarcastic. my humor is more impromptu than
written so hard to convey in a profile. you'll have to trust me -
you'll laugh.",100000

<br />
i've been living in the us for almost two years it has been a huge
change super exciting! i'd say that at this point i love both
europe and california even if i'm still somehow deeply in love
with the country i come from.<br />
<br />
my biggest virtue is the way i can eat a whole pizza in 2 minutes
:-) other minor things are the passion and determination for what i
do in life and i also consider my heavy stubbornness as a positive
thing :-)<br />
<br />
i love being active (in the last couple of years i've done a bunch
of things from gym to rock climbing or snowboarding and many more)
and i always try to do new stuff... something that i'm gonna do any
time soon is skydiving once (bonus if you wanna be my buddy!) and
kickboxing.<br />
<br />
when i'm not riding my motorcycle in bay area i hang out in the
city or i enjoy staying at home maybe cooking something (i cook
delicious pasta-based italian recipes and yes men who like cooking
do exist!!).<br />

i'm not really into american sports since i prefer the motogp (my
religion!!) and the italian soccer (not much lately actually) but
i'm just waiting for someone who can show me how to fall in love
with basket football and baseball :-)<br />

its not because im scared of commitment...i just havent met the
right one.<br />
<br />
my smiling face is here for a couple reasons: i suppose im not the
most aggressive guy you'll find when out at a bar or club. that's
not to say im socially inept or incapable of holding a conversation
with someone of interest it's just that i don't go swinging
through the crowd like a wrecking ball hoping to knock down the
girl of my dreams. don't get me wrong there's nothing better than
getting a quick smile from someone acknowledging a mutual
attraction. when it happens organically i'm the first to welcome
it with a bit of quick wit and engaging conversation. and
secondly im just not out in the ""scene"" as much as i used to be
so i guess this is just another line in the waterer iron in the
fireer some other lousy idiom. in general i think it's become
more challenging to meet people outside of my own circle of
friends since most of them are in relationships married and/or
have kids.<br />

im told i look (and probably act) younger than my age and im
perfectly ok with that. honestly i don't know where the last ten
years have gone. :) im hard-working and somewhat ambitious...but
not to a fault. i try to live by the motto that i work-to-live and
not live-to-work. i lean towards sarcasm or so im told so i hope
you don't mind swapping friendly banter. i appreciate fashion and
don't mind shopping. don't judge! i'm a bit of a sneakerphile and
my leaning tower of denim has become unmanageable. i lead a healthy
lifestyle or at least make an effort to so staying active and in
shape is important to me and ideally you feel the same. other
than going to the gym i spend my free time reading watching
movies trying out sf restaurants procrastinating online playing
softball and other sports or taking my boy biggie for a

creative passionate relentless at mastering his fears. finds
things that are wrong in the world and tries to fix them. wacky
weird off the wall sense of humor. not afraid to break all the
rules even when he probably shouldn't. loyal friend who would drop
everything in a minute to help when it's needed. loves physical
affection and is also someone who recognizes that attraction can go
beyond the physical. great at sports a great mentor and friend to
my teenage sons. that boy's got a lot of love in him.<br />
<br />
then she said don't get a big head. i say that about
everyone.<br />
<br />
a lot of who i am today comes from living through a difficult
childhood experience. i know what it's like to feel a complete
sense of hopelessness. at the time i didn't know how things could
possibly work out for me. as a young adult i came out the other
side and couldn't believe how strong i felt. since then my life
has had a lot of purpose.<br />
<br />
growing up the two places i felt most comfortable were at the
piano and on the sports field. i played classical piano for 8 years
and learned acoustic guitar in college. soccer baseball and tennis
were my favorite sports growing up. i still play a lot of soccer
and am getting back into tennis.<br />
<br />
i'm looking for someone to walk through the world with. someone who
is not afraid to explore experiment try new things. someone who
knows how to love and be loved. someone who will support my dreams
and let me support hers. someone who when we get to the fork in
the road she picks it up whips out a knife and says ""let's eat!""",100000

"heather's existence began about 13.7 billion years ago as she
spent the bulk of her time drifting in expanding cosmos. though she
had no consciousness she eventually settled orbiting 150000000
km from a giant sphere of hydrogen and helium. fractions of heather
absorbed the light energy emitted by this sun and she then stored
this energy in reduced carbon compounds. these reduced parts of
heather were catabolized and cycled through photosynthesis and
metabolism for billions of years. then something spectacular
happened 25 years ago when an egg and sperm joined forces to
create a unique consciousness of incredible physiological
complexity.<br />
<br />
heather quickly learned to eat walk and communicate by the help
of a large family consisting of a mother father 3 brothers and 1
sister. a public school system and structured suburban society of
newbury park ca taught heather skills in social interaction and
helped to familiarize her with the vast amount of knowledge
collected over the centuries. she excelled in school especially
the sciences as she completed honors and advance placement
courses. she gained a stepfather 2 stepsisters and a stepbrother
which was a jarring adjustment but nonetheless a loved addition to
the tribe. she was an excellent assistant manager at a computer
retail store for five years during high school and while attending
ventura college.<br />
<br />
heather moved to los angeles to attend ucla for a b.s. in
biochemistry on scholarship. she was incredibly humbled by the
scope of the universe as she tried to find significance in a world
full of inherent mystery. heather dabbled in organic chemistry and
molecular biology research but quickly realized she could make
more of an impact aligning r&amp;d with commercialization.<br />
<br />
eager to make an impact on the world she took on the challenge of
being first us employee for a german life science instrumentation
company while completing her mba and ms biotechnology over nights
and weekends. sales marketing and product management experience
was a great launching point as she was responsible for n and s
america revenues and building the us distribution and direct sales
team. heather moved onto a us sales manager position for flow
chemistry instrumentation to get into high level negotiations and
capital equipment sales experience. heather excels in her endeavors
through a global perspective sharp business focus passion for
science and understanding of the human condition. her path is
dynamic and fluid focused in adapting to the global market. she
aims to defy the laws of entropy as she makes a brief impact to
justify her significance in the universe.",100000

i'm looking for...fun? adventure? warmth? shelter from the storm? a
comrade or sister in arms? a lover? a bff? yes all that but of
course i have firm boundaries and limits too like i most want a
solid part-time relationship not a full-time thing leading to
marriage or more kids type of thing. i am independent yet flexible
and would make a wonderful mistress even if you are not involved

i consider myself polyamorous not into the poly group scene and
my 'version' of poly in practice is more closely aligned with
wendy-o' matik's viewpoint than easton/liszt. please be aware that
i am involved in a relationship/deep friendship but i have taken
the liberty to list myself as single because listing myself as the
former seems to severely limit okc interactions and i am in many
senses of the word single...with this being said i shy away from
labels about who you and i are and what types of labeled
relationships people create together.",100000
"hello! i enjoy traveling watching movies and hanging out with
friends. my #1 rule for traveling is to go to places where where i
can drink the tap water. =p i've been to japan washington dc new
york london paris china (an exception to rule #1) and many other
places. for the year i haven't decided yet. maybe toronto and
montreal. my taste in movies (and television) fall into three
genres: comedies action and drama. it doesn't matter if the film
is in english or sub-titled (i can't stand dubbed) but it has to
be well-written. aside from the traveling and movies i also enjoy
broadway shows (4 shows in 5 nights in vegas a couple years ago)
bay area sports (except the sharks) online gaming good food and
keeping up with current events.<br />

consistent honest and dependable. i can get serious when i have

originally from los angeles i moved to berkeley in '98 and five
years later ended up in the city to complete pharmacy school at
ucsf. although i enjoy science i love art film and wish i was
more creative. so i make up for this by watching movies going to
museums wishing i could create such amazing things. i recently
moved to dogpatch/potrero hill and enjoy exploring my
neighborhood.<br />

i try to maintain a relatively healthy lifestyle i practice bikram
yoga daily walk about 4 miles a day and try to cook at home (but
sadly i have to admit that i do not like cooking for one so i
usually abuse the whole paycheck salad bar). i love exploring the
city (for the first time in four years i finally feel like i live
in the city again...feel free to ask why) hiking getting
outside....i enjoy taking photos walking my dog....and the list
goes on and on.<br />

i love to laugh making others laugh being goofy but calm and
level headed when necessary. game night dinner a movie walking
around the city are more likely what i'd be doing on a night off
rather than a bar. i do not ski or snowboard (but willing to try)
and i'm learning how to ride a bicycle. i've been told i'm kind
caring loving and open minded.",100000

learning to blues dance and have been known to salsa. i love the

if you havn't tried you're missing-out).<br />

i use proper english spelling. i'm canadian. get over it.<br />

i was born and raised in canada but my family is actually
""african"". our roots on the tropical island of mauritius go back as
far back as the 1700's and our languages are french and creole.
we're everywhere now - i have family in france australia canada
the us parts of asia and africa. i consider myself canadian first.

i take acting at the american conservatory theater. while i'm never

i think you're looking for adventure. i think you're looking for
someone (or even better) someones who can play and have fun in
places that most people can't. i'm that guy.<br />

i'm the guy who can do damn near anything and do it well. i'm the
guy who is a guy all the way through. which means i can dress in
drag and love it. i can suck cock (and i'm really good at it) and
then go down on you or give you a rug burn or touch you so gently
that you have to concentrate fully to feel the subtlety.<br />
<br />
i've have had a very rich life so far. amazingly rich. with that
comes a kind of discernment. i don't fawn over the things that most
people get all willied about. i do fawn over people who express
themselves who demonstrate an active and creative approach to
being alive.<br />

basically you'll either think i'm the biggest asshole that's ever
walked the planet or you'll think ""fuck this guy is on to
something"". and i can tell you for certain that i'm not the
biggest asshole i've met that guy. i might be #4 on the list
though. i've been described as the anti-christ and as the kindest
person you'll ever meet. people have said that i have the highest
standard of anyone they've ever met but almost anyone could live
up to the standards.<br />

i am very confused.",100000
"here's what i've learned from reading profiles on okcupid:<br />
<br />
- 94% of bay area okcupiders are from la/new york/boston. 3% are
from atlanta or texas. 3% are from chicago. 0% are originally from
the bay area.<br />
<br />
- 74% are ""living life to the fullest"". the rest of us apparently
prefer life empty and meaningless.<br />
<br />
- 112% like to do yoga mostly while simultaneously
rock-climbing/snowboarding/scuba diving.<br />
<br />
- 66% ""work hard and party harder"". that must be exhausting.<br />
<br />
- 16% are prepared for the zombie apocalypse. i'm currently more
concerned with the moronpocalypse centered in dc/wherever sarah
palin's bus is.<br />
<br />
- 4% actually picked the _taco suggestion from okcupid when their
first-choice username was already taken.<br />
<br />
i have also learned that there are several obligatory photos women
are required to have:<br />
1) the shot of yourself in a mirror ready to go out (required when
26 or younger)<br />
2) the shot of you in a bridesmaid dress at a friend's wedding
(required when 26 or older)<br />
3) at a giants game<br />
4) in dolores park<br />
5) rock climbing surfing or backpacking<br />
<br />
if you don't have at least 3 of these 5 either you don't live in
sf or you may be exercising creativity in picture selection. i'm
unlikely to judge you based on whether or not your pictures fall
into these categories - but i will if you have a picture of
yourself at a mustache party. not hot ever.<br />

here is a little about me: i'm originally from new york and boston
was in austin for 12 years and just moved to california. people
tell me that i'm a very positive person patient trustworthy and
reliable. i'm very passionate about life and would rather die than
live a life devoid of passion.<br />

i'm a work-hard play-hard kind of guy and i'm all about living
life fully and living a life i love. i surround myself with
positive people and i have good friends and we uplift each others'
lives.<br />

i want to make a significant impact and change the world. i am
looking for a partner who has a similar outlook -- someone who
wants to live an exceptional life who will be my partner-in-crime.
i'm also looking for a mutually giving relationship where we keep
each other's glass of wine full :)<br />

so i'm seeking an exceptional woman. someone with things in common
mutual respect a good person and where conversation flows
naturally so that we can be both friends and lovers. i'm fairly
selective when it comes to dating but i'm also serious if i find
the right special someone.<br />

the most important thing i'm looking for in a partner is someone
who has good core values and is an ""active learner"". someone who
continuously improves herself self-reflects and is intelligent
enough to make positive changes in her life.<br />

i'm also looking for someone with whom i have passionate chemistry
and connection. that is more important than having things in
common since two people with amazing chemistry can find activities
together.",100000
"hey there. i'm an australian who moved to the usa a few years ago
and now i have lived in san francisco for the last couple years.
though i miss my friends and family a lot life is about taking

that philosophy.<br />

life is interesting fun and ever-changing. i think that one of my
best traits is being very inquisitive... don't ever expect me to be
lost for words. doing new things in new places has always been a
priority - i've had the chance to travel all around the world and
i know i've only just scratched the surface.<br />

i can be very shy initially (wait.. where are you going?) so it
might take a while before you truly get to know me. however once i
get comfortable i may seem to be a little sarcastic but that's
only because i am. for some reason i like talking to people who
are quiet-- i ask them a lot of questions and try to bring them out
of their shell.<br />

i lived in south bay for a while until i realized the biggest
attraction there was probably fry's electronics. so i made a move
to san francisco last year and it completely changed my life. i am
passionate about music totally dig the grunge era of the 90s like
playing my guitar and i still dream about becoming a rock star
some day. (statutory warning: i will bring awesome music into your
life).<br />
<br />
i commute a total of 80 miles for work everyday but i do not let
that interfere with my leisure life. i attend music school at ccsf
where i am trying to learn the piano. i go for improv on saturdays
which completely pushes me out of my comfort zone and i am
absolutely loving it. i'm very hardworking and i always like to
keep myself busy. i no longer have a tv and i don't like staying at
home on weekends. i am just super excited to be living in this city
and am always out and about exploring it.<br />

i like to bike hike and do a lot of other stuff outdoors. i like
to read about science. i can be very naive at times (tsk. tsk. tsk
such an awesome guy - but not shrewd enough). apparently nobody
can tell where i'm from. people think i'm german russian or
spanish. but i'm none of those.<br />

who am i looking for ? i'm really not sure. i do not want to go on
a date and compare the person to some fantasy image and tick off
features on a checklist. i'd take you as you come and for who you
are and let you blow my mind in your own way.<br />

i am looking to find someone with the same interests and goals
figured this was a decent place to start. i generally enjoy doing
anything when it's sunny. i like my job but don't love it. i really
like chain restaurants i used to like to surf and used to rip
pretty hard but now i'm just over it probably the water

===&gt;i last updated my profile on...<br />
monday february 28 2011 &lt;===<br />
<br />
-----&gt; i've been away from sf for a little over a year and did
not visit this site... sorry. hope to return to sf soon. it was a
tough year... how i wish to come back and be myself again...<br />
------------<br />
<br />
from my twitter profile:<br />
<strong>a woman who loves women; a feminist openly gay who loves
acting the arts; a non-conformist and rule breaker who is a risk
taker but not a gambler; a sex lover.<br /></strong><br />
<strong>note:</strong> i'm in sekiu for a few days on business...
now (2/28) on to chicago and nyc... here's is hoping that i can be
back soon... in the warm and 'divine' san francisco of my loves...
and lovers...<br />
<br />
---------------<br />
<br />
i'm a fun person openly gay blue/green eyes blondish/redish wavy
hair fit body love sex with other women very passionate
uninhibited fun-loving and carefree. born in san francisco and
living here now. have lived on the east coast (nyc) for a few years
too and went to college there. now i work and live here and travel
up and down the west coast (for my job). the only thing i don't
like about my job is the traveling... but it's good compensation
and i love what i do.<br />
<br />
<strong>who i am...<br />
i am a non-conformist... have broken most societal rules in my
life... and i find it near impossible to follow society's rules and
conventions... i am not a rebel per se though. i just need to be
free to feel and to do to dream and to create to come and to
go... as i please. i can't seem to be quiescent... some say that
i'm a rabble rouser too... and an unflagging
feminist.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>important note</strong><br />
when i discovered this site through an ad in facebook i fell in
love with it and i resolved to disclose and reveal myself (for the
first time ever publicly online!) completely and openly. feelings
thoughts emotions past and present... i do not wish to offend
anyone yet i'm bent on being totally transparent here as i've
never been before online... no one can be all things to all
people... this is me how i know myself from deep inside... over
the years only my very few most intimate lovers have had access to
what i'm 'displaying' here... i can't believe i'm daring to 'expose
and unrap' myself and lay bare for everyone to 'see' me... i love
to go nude and lay in the sand on nude beaches and yes i'm an
exhibitionist... but this is beyond all that; it feels like my deep
inner soul is being dished out for everyone to devour...<br />
<br />
<strong>my public profile</strong><br />
my public (more structured and objective) profile is on facebook
(see ""michelle leboussy""). here i have my more intimate and open
profile where my real friends/lovers can 'see' me as i really am
and can read how i openly feel about everything... here i talk
openly about myself and who i am my likes and dislikes... my
fears my deepest emotions my fun times and in a word... my
soul... i feel that here i'm free to express myself and that i'm
accepted for what i am. i love this website... so different and
inviting.<br />
<br />
<strong>i am a gay woman</strong><br />
i like adventures both physical and emotional with other women. i
love to flirt with other women wherever we meet regardless of
whether they are gay or bisexual or straight. however i wish to
meet only other gay women; no bisexuals or straights or anything
else.<br />
<br />
<strong>dating</strong><br />
for dating i only want gay women who are uninhibited and open to
having sex on our first encounter. i'm open to casual fun sex
relationships as well as longer term relationships. i'm mostly a
polyamorous gay woman yet enjoy many and diverse casual sex

i'm healthy and health conscious and don't do hard drugs. i
exercise and keep in good condition (hey it works well with my
bedroom hobbies...).<br />

<strong>drugs</strong><br />
i don't 'do' hard drugs and <strong>never</strong> will. i drink
socially but on the low end (not that much). from time to time i
enjoy grass specially before a night of sex with someone special.
but i'm not a regular user maybe once in a blue moon sometimes
even less. however if you do use hard recreational drugs... i'm
not going to 'exclude' you... as you may need a warm loving and
tender hand to lean on and to share yourself with...",100000

"hey thanks for checking out my profile my name is darrel i'm new
to san fran and i'm a little lost in translation so a friend
actually recommended this site to me.<br />
<br />
so about me well like i said my name is darrel and i'm new to the
bay area. i graduated last year with a masters in molecular biology
from uw-m. moved out to san francisco because i've always loved the
ocean and well i was offered a great job here.<br />
<br />
anywho i'm at home the most in a t-shirt and blue jeans. i'm told
i have a great sense of humor caring and very generous. i love
animals especially dogs. i enjoy all most all types of music
except for excessively country music. i also love most kinds of
foods by my favorite is chinese by far.<br />
<br />
in addition to my professional life i have a bunch of extra
curricular hobbies. some of my favorites are rock climbing hiking
and jogging biking and cooking. i also like to dance latin
jazz and swing just to name a few although i haven't done it
since i've moved.",100000
"hey<br />
<br />
my name is rob and i'm 26 years old live in san francisco and
work for facebook in a productlaunch role. i really enjoy my career
and live an active social and busy lifestyle.<br />
<br />
to be straightforward this is my first time using an online dating
site. i'm on here because i'm looking to meet someone outside the
context of bars who shares my interests and/or outlook.<br />
<br />
my background: though i was born and raised in the bay area
originally i attended a boarding school for high school in
southern california. in 2008 i graduated from stanford and spent a
year as a pro skier before returning to the bay area to join the
corporate world.<br />
<br />
i would describe myself as social and gregarious. i am a work hard
play hard kind of guy and enjoy attending lots of
giants/49ers/stanford football games going out with friends in the
city or jetting up to tahoe at the last minute on a friday.<br />
<br />
i'm also active and into outdoor sports. i'm not one to walk around
in a gym or step onto a treadmill. instead i strongly prefer
getting outside and running bay swimming surfing sailing or
skiing! did i mention skiing? i have had a lifelong passion for the
sport and even pursued it professionally for a year - almost a lot
longer. it was a wild year and i'd be happy to tell you about
it.<br />
<br />
anyway i'm looking for a teammate or a ""partner in crime"" if you
will. i don't have a specific type but i'm looking for someone who
finds that what i have written here resonates with her.<br />

"hey. my friend terri says this site kicks <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=ass"">ass</a>. that i must see...i hope it's worth me
writing 110 characters.<br />
<br />
i am once twice and three times a lady<br />
<br />
(more? you think more? okay more...)<br />
<br />
i'm adorable funny as hell and loved instantly by dogs and small
children. (the little girl in the pictures is not mine btw.) i
drive an altima hybrid (first new car in eleven years) and don't
litter. i can change a tire and carry a tune or vice versa. i do
wicked imitations of homestar runner snoop dogg and mitch from ""a
mighty wind"". i have unlocked the secret of iced tea. it's a rare
day that i don't make it to peet's. i wrote a one-act play that was
performed at a festival in austin. i held the kansas state record
for youngest county spelling champion for over 20 years (until some
little indian girl took it from me...my request for a drug test is
on appeal). i drove ten friends up to oregon and back in a huge van
and didn't lose anybody. i read as much as possible and watch ""the
wire"" and ""the shield"" more than i should.<br />
<br />
i'm at the crux of bad art and denatured science -- an engineer in
a band (and haven't you had about enough of those?). technically
i'm in two bands. yeah i know right? i swear. finally finished my
first cd (aptly titled ""sorry for the wait"") in 2008 so if you go
out with me you'll probably at least get a free one. currently
writing/recording/practicing music takes up a lot of my free time
but there's plenty more left. i've lived in the city for 15 years
and i rarely get tired of exploring when there's someone to explore
with. and that would be you. come on. you know it is.<br />

<br />
1) i don't drink. i don't care if you do though.<br />

you're lying about yours.<br />

"hi and thanks for visiting my official okcupid profile! ha -- i'm
new to this but thought it would be interesting to give this site a
shot so here goes:<br />
<br />
i think i'm a likable guy in fact one of my co-workers just
recently described me as a ""cool-ass motherfucker"" so at least one
person thinks so.<br />

i like:<br />
music food laughing my friends and family movies happy hours
dive bars cycling going to concerts graphic design and art
baseball basketball mexican food sushi vintage maps board
games card games traveling and just generally enjoying cool stuff
life has to offer.<br />

--&gt; s.f.) and have lived in sf for just over 8 years now. i love
this town and how much fun it always is. that said i'm not opposed

"hi everyone i am scott i think it should be said right away that i
am a single father of two amazing boys (5 1/2 yrs 2 1/2 yr). i
don't have full custody but probably a little more than half of
the time they are with me. they are everything to me and i need
someone who loves kids and can be understanding to that situation.
if you are open to that idea the good news is that they are two of
the cutest smartest and most amazing little guys. (i am not just
saying that because i am their father &lt;-- or just saying that
either lol)<br />
<br />
i am a very active person and i love to travel. going away for a
weekend of skiing / snowboarding visiting the coast is always fun.
i love the bay area there are so many cool things to do and so many
great places to eat. i enjoy going out to movies concerts parks
museums or plays. i am very open to trying new things or going to
new places. i rarely judge things before i have given them a fair
shot. i find that i am often pleasantly surprised when i approach
things that way. the reality is that i am not so concerned with
what i am doing but rather who i am with. i love to spend time
with family friends and the person i am dating.<br />
<br />
i am a very outgoing and entertaining person. i have a sarcastic
sense of humor and i don't take myself or situations to seriously.
i firmly believe that time heals all wounds and can fix all
situations; if you can't laugh through the hard times life will
get pretty unmanageable. it is never a straight ride to the top
but with the love of friends family and a partner you can be happy
no matter what happens.",100000

brothers and their families were here and now with a great job
great friends and all the bay area has to offer i'm here to
stay!<br />

friends describe me as confident and sassy and while i can
initially seem like a tough cookie on the outside my friends know
how truly vulnerable i can be. i'm pretty independent and am
totally comfortable with who i am and where i am in my life but i'm
sort of old school in some ways in that i don't think chivalry
should totally be dead.<br />

i enjoy going to movies museums the theater working out and
being outside in general. i love a five star resort as much as i
love five days backcountry. i enjoy cooking and baking but also
enjoy dining out. admittedly i dine out more than i cook as it's a
way i spend time with my friends and honestly is just easier after
a long day at work!",100000
"hi there!<br />
<br />
so here is the challenging part - this is my story:<br />
<br />
i am a born and bred london city boy now living in san francisco.
&nbsp;i consider myself silly yet serious spontaneous yet
structured. &nbsp;sounds a confusing mix but i think it is simply a
balance of focused and fun.<br />
<br />
being a real foody i think i am in a great place and always enjoy
trying new restaurants and bars. &nbsp;i am fun and &nbsp;sociable
so always try to do something in the week even if i have a busy
schedule.<br />
<br />
i am hoping to meet someone with whom i can spend time together
whether that would be going for a run over the golden gate bridge
sharing a bottle of wine on a sunday afternoon or heading out of
town.<br />
<br />
my friends see me as a gentleman but i like to dress smartly and be
courteous as much as i like camping and trekking. &nbsp;i am hoping
to meet someone who also enjoys a balance of smart and
casual.<br />
<br />
i travelled through south america africa and india so i am always
thinking of my next trip and challenge so hoping to meet someone
who also enjoys some adventure. &nbsp;i feel most at home in the
mountains either skiing off-piste or trekking in the himalayas so
look forward to heading out to tahoe for a winter weekend.<br />
<br />
i love to make people laugh and always living life to the full.
&nbsp;i am easy going thoughtful and happy to have a relaxing
night in at home so hopefully i will meet someone who also enjoys a
chat and down time.<br />

having never done internet dating i am not sure what to expect but
i certainly hope to meet someone - even if it would mean just being
friends or activity partners.",100000

now but some days i wonder if i ever really will so here it goes.

"hi! - i guess the number one thing to know about me is that i like
to create. i've always created things for a living and it's always
been immensely satisfying.<br />
<br />
i've been involved with a really wide array of things - some of
what i've done over the years:<br />
<br />
- made muzak for a japanese department store<br />
- made music for lego commercials<br />
- taught piano to little kids<br />
- helped build a home studio for a reggae artist<br />
- made a speech synthesizer<br />
- made sound collages for the anti-defamation league to scare
people with.<br />
<br />
i keep up with what's going on in the world to an almost absurd
degree (i valiantly try to read the economist cover to cover before
the next one arrives) .<br />
<br />
i try to be well-rounded and i guess i'm kind of an information
sponge. i seem to usually be the person people come to to ask
questions about things. so you can probably ask me about anything
and get answers.<br />
<br />
i'm originally from new england and went to a prep school but
don't hold these things against me please. i may or may not have
some qualities associated with these things.. hopefully the
positive ones?<br />
<br />
i went to college in boston and miss it.. the city not college.
back bay in the summer getting lost amongst the narrow winding
streets of beacon hill shopping for music on a whim at
midnight.<br />

i've lived in rural connecticut boston atlanta and greater el

teacher.<br />

me a long time to learn to be as grateful as i should be for that.
keeping perspective is the salve for all sorts of imagined
wounds.<br />

i'd love to meet someone creative or who appreciates creativity
someone who can amuse and entertain themselves someone who enjoys
conversation and silence in equal measure.",100000
"hi! here goes my self summary:<br />
i am a very open minded person who loves exploring new things.
sometimes i like going to extremes. i believe there is so much to
explore out there amazing creations of god that life seems so
short..i think the more you explore the more knowledge you acquire
and the better you understand the world around you. also i want to
make use of and discover all my senses that might be potentially
hidden by experiencing new things.<br />
<br />
now why i am here on okc? i am here to make some good friends for
dating etc. that experience is an important part of life as i want
to find someone whom i care more than anything who can become my
inspiration who can motivate me towards new walks of life making
my journey satisfactory and wholesome inturn learning to
reciprocate the same feeling.<br />
here i am looking for some new friends for hanging out doing fun
activities and then see where things take off from there may be
just for fun!<br />
<br />
also i am very kind at heart optimist appreciate all little
things and little moments. i have recently started taking some
dance classes and i am loving it.",100000
"hi! hmmmm where to start? i'm not boring? seriously i'm in a
great place in my life and i'm just looking to keep things fun and
interesting.<br />
<br />
i enjoy being active because it makes sitting on my butt that much
more sweet and well-deserved! i like my long trail runs up in
marin and my shorter runs in gg park. i practice yoga regularly
swim and enjoy snowboarding (i am a big proponent of the winter
ski-lease).<br />
<br />
music is my passion and something that inspires me. i'm always
down to check out a show and i secretly dream of being a rock star
(who doesn't?) but my debut at open mic night in waimanalo did not
land me a recording contract so i'll stick to singing to my
dog.<br />
<br />
food is a favorite pasttime of mine and i enjoy a great meal as
well as cooking for my friends and family although i could
probably do without the clean-up afterwards (anyone
interested?).<br />
<br />
i have traveled to various parts of europe asia and south
america and there are still tons of places that i would like to
visit....it would be cool to find a travel buddy!<br />
<br />
okay what else? my friends have described me as being witty kind
and simply awesome (okay i may be paraphrasing here). i like
sarcasm and cynicism but with a healthy dose of gratitude and
optimism thrown in for good measure. not sure if that makes sense
to you. i live with honesty and curiosity and strive to be amused
and intellectually stimulated on a daily basis...<br />
<br />
okay i guess that's about it...except maybe that i look way cuter
in person?!?!?<br />

"hi! i was born in iceland grew up in philadelphia moved to sf
about 11 years ago and just recently made the big move to oakland.
i've had the opportunity to travel own a business create music
and art professionally tour in bands experience the desert live
in the mountains help build companies and make amazing life-long
friends.<br />
<br />
i'm independent but provide unconditionally for people i love and
trust. my big thing is striving for balance i'm confident in my
decisions but understand the importance to grow from my mistakes.
i'm hyper-aware of my social responsibility to our planet and to
each other but with the understanding that i can only change what
is in my control and serves my ultimate happiness.<br />

contrary to all this ""thoughtful"" banter i'm also a prankster with
an east coast sense of humor... my day is considerably less awesome

for too long without finding some way to distract the people around
me. i just like seeing people laugh you know?<br />

things that turn me on...<br />
you are creative passionate about your interests stylish
appreciative confident healthy and generally go out of your way
to make people happy because this makes you happy. you leave a
small footprint but your heart is as wide as an open sky. you're a
sensual person and you know what you want. you're a great kisser
too.<br />

profile (happy to share) but i visit sf regularly and the web app
is very regionally specific. while a home-owner &amp;
business-owner in cambridge with most of my
friends/contacts/family/colleagues here - i'm looking to make
friends in sf and possibly find an excuse to move to the left coast

"hi! i'm honest genuine humble loyal quirky a good listener
and affectionate...<br />
<br />
i came to the us from another country twelve years ago. i'm going
to let you try and work out what country it was. maybe something in
my profile provides a valuable hint?<br />
<br />
the funny accent is still there but it's fast disappearing.
admittedly i didn't exactly come from a developing country but i
had nothing when i stepped off the plane except what was stuffed
into my suitcases and a strong desire to be the best that i could
be here. since i'm not from around these parts my opinions and
humor can be a little different to what some may expect.<br />
<br />
i also lived in southern california when i first came to the us
(never again!) and i was fortunate (or unfortunate) enough to live
in montana for a short period as well. when i was younger i also
lived on the island paradise of fiji for a few years.<br />
<br />
a recent passion has been learning to dance. for just over a year
i've been learning several varieties of ballroom dance including
cha-cha foxtrot hustle rumba salsa swing tango and waltz. if
you noticed that those were listed in alphabetical order then top
marks to you. by day i'm a meek mild manner engineer but at night
i turn into a dancing machine! it's a great feeling to learn a new
step and then to actually execute it well with a partner who
doesn't know it's coming.<br />
<br />
when i'm not dancing you may find me playing tennis or squash. for
those that don't know squash may on first appearances look
somewhat similar to racquetball except that racquetball absolutely
sucks.<br />
<br />
my sense of humor is self deprecating black and i like mocking
those in authority and those on high moral ground are all fair
game.<br />
<br />
there are two philosophies that i try to live by. give everyone the
benefit of the doubt and if your afraid of something confront it
and overcome that fear.<br />
<br />
who am i looking for? i don't have a laundry list. the type of
person i think i may be most attracted to is probably positive a
little adventurous has a curious mind and may have been exposed
to different cultures during her life. bonus points if you can
dance. double bonus points if you don't have a clue how to dance
but would like to learn!",100000
"hi! so i'm fairly new-ish to san francisco and the bay area having
moved here from baltimore md about a year ago. i grew up in socal-
orange county but made my east coast move going to johns hopkins
for college and then work after. i loved baltimore for my friends
but what a relief that i'm finally back in cali! i love san
francisco and am mesmerized everyday by the people and just the
melting pot of culture that is sf!<br />
<br />
in general i would say i'm a pretty adventurious fun loving
person. my motto has always been: i rather look stupid than scared
so i would try anything and sometimes just make a fool of myself!
i also love to laugh and love making people laugh. i like to
always stay positive; life is way too short to worry about things
we can't control.<br />

so of course i signed up for this to meet someone interesting. i've
realized a long time ago that i'm never going to meet that special

i live in sf and love to get a full day of this great city... or
wherever i happen to be.<br />
<br />
during the week i tuck in my shirt walk downtown to my office
start the day with some fancy-ass coffee and keep a strong
lunch-hour yoga practice. i spend most afternoons helping others
just to breathe... and reminding folks that the world won't end
tomorrow. sometimes i get some actual work or even writing done.
i'm social for dinner a few evenings a week. especially when it's
my turn to host the bbq. i also spend a night or two closing down
the indoor climbing gym. and occasionally i do take a night off to
cuddle up with my giant yellow labrador retriever. he makes an
excellent pillow.<br />
<br />
weekends vary between getting outdoors and enjoying the city life.
last summer included a few easy backpacking trips a couple
overnight sea kayaking adventures and numerous local rock climbing
sessions. now i'm waiting to use my new skis this winter. when i'm
in the city i prefer a ticketed concert or private party. bar
hopping is for happy hour when i can avoid the bridge and tunnel
crowd.<br />
<br />
my favorite domestic trip of the year was totally new orleans for
jazz fest. now i'm planning a cheap 2-week road trip with a college
buddy through germany and poland for march. after spending some
family-and-old-friends time on the east coast for the holidays...",100000
"hi i'm james.<br />
<br />
i just finished law school and am lucky to have landed a gig in
this beautiful city at a really laid back start-up venture capital
firm. i am passionate about what i do but at the end of the day i
prefer to leave work at the office and focus on family friends
and personal interests. in my free time i like writing exercising
and restoring old cars. i'm fascinated by body language so if you
like covert people-watching maybe we can be partners in
crime.<br />
<br />
i love new challenges - a life without learning seems boring. after
college i played poker for a living for a few years (my parents
warned me about majoring in philosophy) but that lifestyle grew
tiresome very quickly. i prefer to use my talents and intellect to
make more of a difference. i spent a year as an americorps
volunteer developing robotics programs in the philadelphia school
district. i've also had the pleasure of working as a projectionist
at one of the best-preserved art-deco theaters in the country (i
got to handle the original library of congress print of
""casablanca"" - nerdgasm). now i'm in sf for a new adventure.",100000
"hi i'm mike; i'm a little quirky and i can usually make any crowd
laugh. i consider myself to be open-minded adventurous
intellectual and caring. when i'm not working or snowboarding i'm
hanging out with friends catching downtime or exploring my new
city by bike/moto/car/etc. it's clich but i work hard so that i
can play hard.<br />
<br />
i listen to a lot of music laugh as often as possible stay up on
worthwhile current events (not that faux news type bullshit) enjoy
travelling appreciate nature treasure deep conversations
question the world/norm and i love trying new things. i find
happiness through expanding my knowledge and breadth of experience
making others happy being generous with friends and family
finding balance and spending money on things i love.<br />
<br />
i'm generally cautious respectful shy and responsible; but when
i'm really comfortable i like speaking my mind taking risks
joking around sarcastically and showing affection it's fun to cut
loose.",100000
"hi new to this site. still figuring it out.<br />
<br />
love the bay area in part because 4 hrs by car takes you to
somewhere similar to the rest of the country. have travelled the
world quite a bit for work in the past and took time to enjoy the
travel (museums concerts theatre the beach- cassis- etc). adding
activities back from sports related knee reconstruction. walk 3-4
miles a day. picked up rowing in whaleboats for local exercise.
ready willing able to start a family!<br />
<br />
i am midwesterner monogamous and smart",100000
"hi thanks for checking me out! i just want to see if there are any
available ladies who might be interested in a gentlemen who knows
how to treat them with respect and courtesy. i consider myself to
be relaxed humorous generous and kind. i am a successful
full-time professional live and work in the benicia/concord area.
i'm busy and passionate about life have 2 wonderful grown
daughters and am looking to meet someone whose company i can enjoy
and who can appreciate being taken out on the town once in awhile
(yes i'm old-fashioned that way corny but true!). you must have a
passion for life and love also!",100000

<br />
i live in san francisco and work in the south bay. my profession is
software engineering. i consider myself bi-cultural... having both
chinese heritage but grew up in america. are you interested thus
far? :)",100000
"hi<br />
as you can tell i am into the yoga spirituality and meditation
thing. that said i am not a freak about it. i used to teach. i was
vegetarian for 5 years but now experiment with meat. i think
sustainable local organic meats really feed your muscles well. i
am a software engineer by profession and am always working on side
projects. as a matter of fact i work for a company that develops
sports apps for facebook. so i play on facebook and watch sports
as a profession. i love to travel (traveled around the world in
'06) i love cooking and going to fine resturants. i love the
outdoors as well...ever been to esalen? i love that place. i love
harbin as well.<br />
<br />
i am silly active and expanding",100000
"hi. i am a 44 y/o professional with a lot of heart. i am a
passionate creative intelligent and direct person. i am employed

get to do some international travel for work. i do work a lot of
hours so my free time is important to me and i would like to share
it with someone that is special.<br />
<br />
i grew up in madison wi and spent most of my life on the east
coast. i have a strong mid-west work ethic and a bit of a dry east
coast sense of humor. i think i can be pretty funny...but i will
let you be the judge. :-&gt;<br />
<br />
i am looking for a fun and long-term relationship. i have tried
some casual dating and it just isn't for me. i want more of a
long-term friend and partner. my last serious relationship lasted
for over ten years and ended on pretty good terms (well - as good
as these things go) and i want to go way past that milestone this
time.",100000
"hi. i have no idea why you are here but i know you are a busy gal
and i have max 5 more seconds to hold your attention. so to serve
both our interests i am not gonna waste your time and cut right to
the chase. buckle up. i'm extremely wealthy i own various mansions
up on cliffs that overlook the ocean with this crystal clear water
that you like so much in this favorite country of yours. i have
multiple red sports cars a horse ranch and my very own ngo
devoted to helping women with breast cancer. ... pfft!! come on
now you don't wanna hear what i have or don't have!<br />
i know what you wantyou just want me to tell you how much i like
animals that i have a passion for life and holding deep
stimulating conversations that challenge and intrigue you. that i
am adventurous but not in the
i-have-traveled-to-35-countries-and-thats-all-i-talk-about-way but
more in the
my-life-is-full-of-excitement-because-i-take-risks-and-am-willing-to-try-new-things-way.
you also want to hear that i have a great sense of humor and that
sarcasm and irony are my bitches over whom i masterfully command.
not to forget that i am definitely very driven in my pursuit of a
reputable challenging career but simultaneously completely able
to forget about business and put family first when i go home at the
end of the day to give you a neck massage. of course none of those
qualities matter or hold much weight if you don't find me
attractive so you'll just browse through the pics and won't even
read this cause let's face it hardly anyone reads profiles which
is why i'm checking to make sure you are... if you got this far and
have looked at the picshigh five!<br />
so now that the basics are covered you're looking for that spark
that connection that holy shit i want him!-moment. well
sister let me tell you something: stop bothering. it saddens me
but you are very unlikely to find this moment here.<br />
speaking of special moments my birthday is almost here i should
get myself something. what did you get yourself for your birthday?
you did remember to buy yourself something right? rather than
sending me hate mail about my profile send me an email and tell me
what it is you got yourself for your birthday. let's face facts
you take care of everyone all year long but who takes care of you?",100000
"hi. i was born in england grew up in connecticut went to prep
school and was educated at columbia and chicago. i have been in sf
five years after 15 in nyc.<br />
<br />
i am kind of preppy but not excessively.<br />
<br />
i like sailing. i read a lot: literature history politics art. i
like architecture.<br />
<br />
i am in good shape because i walk a lot. i also like bicycling i
learned to ski downhill this spring in tahoe and i ice skate in the
off-season.<br />
<br />
i have a tart sense of humor. i like to go to art galleries. i love
photo-realist art and would buy more art but there isn't any more
room in my apartment. i have a storage locker full of antique
furniture i bought but can't use right now. (i am kind of a magpie
for beautiful objects.) i have a great need to experience beautiful
things -- antiques design books -- and i love to browse stores
that are full of them. i think that everything that can be
beautiful should be.<br />
<br />
i am moderately materialistic. i am more interested in business as
a game and a battle of wits than in the accumulation of wealth per
se.<br />
<br />
i am not religious but i don't mind if you are. i was raised
christian but no longer believe. (i have been described as ""a
stoic"" and tend to look to ancient greece spiritually
speaking.)<br />
<br />
i like to listen to enigma moby phillip glass pink floyd atb
mahler. i can loop the same ambient techno song for hours.<br />
<br />
i read f. scott fitzgerald dominick dunne arthur conan doyle
tolstoy. (i hate modern pseudo-intellectual literature.)<br />
<br />
i am sensitive but not a wimp.<br />
<br />
i love the new england countryside; i'm not quite yet as sold on
rural california. i hate driving but i love trains. i like the view
from tall buildings (which is why i live in one). i love the
complexity of the city.<br />
<br />
i can be very devoted. i am naturally loyal.<br />
<br />
i'm looking for a woman with a sweet nature which i will
reciprocate.<br />
<br />
i'd prefer someone without too much neurosis.<br />
<br />
my divorce was friendly; i don't have issues with it.<br />
<br />
i really enjoy intelligence in a woman: a high caliber mind of
whatever kind.<br />
<br />
sane values are important to me. i'm not a corn-fed traditional
values boy but i'm not a maniac either.<br />
<br />
physically i would say that gentle and affectionate sensuality
excites me the most.<br />
<br />
i have a wide eye for beauty and appreciate the under-appreciated.
quirky-pretty is good; classically beautiful works on me
too.<br />
<br />
if you would be willing to make me pancakes for breakfast i would
regard that as a really good sign and will be putty in your
hands.<br />

i have a small daughter (4; she's in some of my pictures) who lives
with her mom in l.a. i fly down there once a week to see her.",100000

i'm irish by descent and actually hold a dual citizenship with
u.s. and ireland (but i was born and raised in the us).<br />
<br />
i lead a pretty charmed life. i am always up for getting out of the
house and doing something with friends but if left to my own
devices i will usually be at my computer or playing my piano.<br />
<br />
in relationships i seem to gravitate towards geeks and creative
types.",100000
"hi. i'm tom. i'm not your average cookie-cutter kind of guys. i
have no baggage. i own my house. have a nice paying career. no
crazy ex-girlfriends. i've never cheated on anyone. no one's
perfect but i always try to better myself. life's great. work's
great. now all i need is someone great to share that with.<br />

i'm a movie screening rep for the studios. i get paid to watch
movies before they're released to the general public. i hope you
like movies 'cuz you're gonna get spoiled! :-)<br />

i tend to be attracted to mixed white hispanic asian and middle
eastern women but am opened to possibilities.<br />

"hm i am ... a young professional an athlete a casual gamer a
poker player a traveler an optimist dedicated and
colorblind.<br />
<br />
originally i am from germany. i grew up there lived in california
for a year went back for a few years lived in australia for a
year went back for a few months and then ended up in pittsburgh.
in july i am moving to san francisco for work.<br />
<br />
i love airports and there is no better thing then flying. thinking
about flying somewhere new always gets me excited and makes me
happy! ""there is no better way to fly!"" if you recognize that
slogan then you also know what my favorite airline is :)",100000
"hmm so lets see how i can describe myself. this isn't usually how i
meet people but i'll give it a whirl.<br />
<br />
i moved here from the state of florida land of great mystery a
population of twenty-somethings mixed with 80-somethings and
ridiculous murder stories that only florida would be known for. and
also apparently bath-salt eating crazy people who chew on other
people's faces too i guess. go figure.<br />
<br />
i eat taco bell when i'm drunk. or mels. whichever is closer.<br />
<br />
i work for a social games company in the city. everytime you buy
those virtual tomatoes i'm probably the one figuring out how i can
get you to buy more. my contribution to society for the
moment.<br />
<br />
i also love to laugh and if you ask me i find myself rather
hilarious...but you'll have to be the judge i suppose...",100000
"hmm where do i begin for starters i have a great sense of humor (i
am told ... let me also say that i have never been accused of being
overly modest :p ) . i looooove stand up comedy!! i would describe
my sense of humor varying from witty to racy ...well you get the
point.<br />
i am as spontaneous as they come... usually my calendar isnt filled
with things to do until the last hour whatever that feels right at
that time is the agenda.(does not mean i cant plan).<br />
<br />
i like listening to different genres of music... although i have my
reservations about heavy metal i think i can adapt to most musical
tastes.<br />
<br />
finally  something i really believe in - live and let live!",100000
"hmm.. not sure how to really describe myself. well i'm really laid
back usually a little bit late everywhere. i love cooking and good
wine i hate getting up early and cleaning and i really really
like skiing and golf (would like to try surfing or kite surfing
sometime)... and i just recently bought my own place in
emeryville.<br />
<br />
i would like to meet someone who is independent smart nice and
basically a sweet person (oh and you have to like dogs too). i'm
looking for someone who likes to have fun (ie going out on
weekends playing sports... or other stuff) ...<br />
<br />
i'm definitely a type b personality and am very passionate about
my job but i try my best to keep my work life and personal life
completely separate and never take too much home from the office.",100000
"hmm... been here in bay area for almost a year now finding this
place interesting. i moved from colorado to here like photography
hiking rock climbing and movies.",100000
"hmm... goofy and down to earth.. laid back... sarcasm by the
truckload... a bit of an asshole... etc<br />
<br />
i don't like to talk about myself much but what i can say is that
i just moved to san francisco from the midwest (indiana) at the
beginning of aug. i write software for a fashion e-commerce
startup. i'm also the cto for a non-profit that mentors high-school
kids about pursuing their passions in life and avoiding the
obstacles that will keep them from being successful. i play guitar
i wrestled my entire life up through college i like to camp hike
and rock climb. i'm very laid back and easy going. i love pizza and
burgers and chinese food -- my weaknesses. i'm a huge music
fanatic especially jam bands and jazz. some people would call me a
hippie due to my music tastes and laid back demeanor but i
actually shower work hard and don't do many drugs. i love to
drink good beer (specifically ipas) and eat good food. i go to the
gym daily to stay in shape now that i don't wrestle anymore. i love
to cook too. that's all i can think of for now.. other than that
you'll have to ask<br />
<br />
oh and i just moved from nob hill over to the nopa area...",100000
"hmm... smart well-traveled athletic introspective kind
self-deprecating loyal honest a good friend masculine and in
touch with the feminine.<br />

the back-story: grew up in the leafy suburbs of pa. finished
college and drove out west in a 1967 cashmere white vw van to
explore my early wine habit by working a crush in the napa valley.
was planning on making it a round trip until the van caught fire
and burnt to the ground on my way home from work. after harvest was
over i caught a ride down to sf and have been by the bay ever since
with some breaks for traveling and living a bit in south africa.",100000
"hmm..... try my best to describe myself in english....<br />
<br />
i'm an optimistic clever well-educated energetic person. i'm
from china and did research program in us for 2.5 years. i grad
from usc move to san mateo now. i love my work of developing

but how about off work?<br />
i do hiking driving camping.<br />
i play soccer(messi barcelona fc!) tennis basketball. i like
swimgym. i play saxophone!<br />
<br />
i like to meet people of course i'm respectful open-minded and a
good listener.<br />

oh most important thing i'm single for a while life is good
friends are awesome but i find i miss something important in the
life a good lady? a romantic story? hmmm...... i began to feel
lonely~~",100000
"hmmm... where to start. i grew up outside of new york city (the
real ""city"") and went to school in michigan. i moved to san fran
from richmond va about a year ago for work. best move i ever made
- i love ny and the east coast but everything i enjoy doing there
is just better out here.<br />
<br />
i'm currently working as an manager of analytics at a financial
startup in palo alto. the job is amazing the commute... less
so.<br />
<br />
i love outdoor activities. i'm constantly hiking backpacking rock
climbing skiing or just relaxing at a park. my dream vacation is
spending a month backpacking in new zealand (always been planning
on that trip but life hasn't given me the opportunity to travel
yet. maybe sometime soon!).<br />
<br />
oh i'm also a huge reader mainly classic lit and thrillers but
i'll pick up anything that looks good. there's no better way to
relax than to sit outside and read.",100000
hold tight.,100000
"honestly i don't know what to put here ...all i do know is i am
tired of being alone and tired of girls and games all i want is one
good woman thats good to me that i can settle down with and be
happy and share our lives hopes for the future dreams and goals i
am really shy and probably wont make the first move but all i am
looking for is a chance to show some woman i am a great catch and
am capable of being mr forever ...but we will never know unless you
message me.<br />
<br />
hello.<br />
my name is randy and i am a sweet kind loving young man with a lot
to offer the right woman. i am 23 years old. i finished a double
major at the university of maryland with my studies in counter
terror and criminology as well as a minor in international
relations in 2011. i now run a small but rapidly expanding private
security firm in california. i spent five years in the marine corps
as a special ops sargent. i like what i do and am proud of my
accomplishments. my friends and family are important to me i was
born in san francisco and raised all over northern california so i
have a lot of friends and a rather big family. i enjoy many forms
of art and music. i love to travel and cook a lot when im not
taking contracts i cook for a local catering company an teach
others to cook or protect them selves i enjoy learning about other
cultures and history. i love the feeling of living in the moment i
am also a hopeless romantic that loves to cuddle with the one im
with i am looking for a long term relationship to catch my eye you
must be unique and fun",100000
"honestly i have always found writing long essays very boring. so
i am going to keep this short. i consider myself as a simple guy
and i prefer spending time in the company of my close friends in a
pub/club or watching a movie (i am a total movie buff).
occasionally i get a sudden urge to hop onto a flight a go to
places with my friends (i manage to convince my friends about a
trip all the time :p). however i still feel that there is a lot in
life that i have yet to experience. hope some great experience
starts here :)",100000
"hopefully those close to me would say i'm a fairly decent person
overall although sometimes i can be a son of a bitch. because thats
pretty much my deal. i'm not quite sure what i'm looking for in
life exactly but i'm pretty sure it has something to do with
tassels. and adventures.<br />
<br />
i'm a teacher an artist a son a brother a good friend and work
very hard to maintain a well-balanced fulfilling and happy life.",100000
"how can i summarize a person as complex as me? i enjoy my work as
an emergency department nurse skiing ice skating camping
hanging out with friends and my son. i'm a down-to-earth no frills
kinda guy. i'm not materialistic don't really enjoy being around
people who are - ""things"" don't impress me that much. it's the
friendship the time together the fun and conversations that i
cherish.",100000
"how to describe me hmmm... i definitely have my quirks but then
again isn't that what makes a person unique? i mean who doesn't
check the alarm clock 10 times in a row just to make sure it's on
or check underneath the bed for boogeyman before going to sleep
j/k :-) i'd have to say that my best quality is my sense of humor
albeit sometimes a sarcastic one. i can usually find something
funny or ironic in almost everything. anything that makes me laugh
especially when its least expected always makes me feel good and
that's what i try to do with people around me.<br />
<br />
i'm open to trying most things at least once because you never
know what you might like. i mean whoever thought that raw fish
would be good until you actually try it. i also like learning new
things and developing new skills some of it useful and some not so
useful. replacing a bathroom toilet useful; knowing the pi=3. 14
probably not so much unless of course i'm trying to make the
worlds largest pancake and need to know how much flour to get at
the grocery store :-) i'm a bit of an information junkie and my
mind is like a sponge; no not porous and waterlogged but the kind
that easily soaks up new information. in that respect i guess i'll
always be somewhat of a student at heart. because once you stop
learning you stop evolving. so i may spend an hour on wikipedia
just because i found an interesting article on eiffel tower or
hang out at the book store just because i had an urge to read
something new. i'm aware of the world around me. i'm interested in
politics and world events and enjoy thought provoking conversations
about them. there's so much going on these days it seems as if
things change so rapidly and sometimes it's hard to keep up.<br />
<br />
i definitely consider myself a romantic at heart. i like letting
someone that i care about know it. it might be just opening a door
taking a walk together giving a compliment or listening at the
end of a hard day but something that makes a person feel good. i
mean if you care about someone why not show it and let them know
they're important to you! because you never know what might happen
tomorrow. if someone is in need and i have the ability to help
then i will try and not expect something in return. just the act
of giving sometimes is the reward in and of itself.<br />
<br />
i love little gadgets and am fascinated by technology. i hoping
they'll come out with a coffee mug/iphone/swiss army knife soon.
it's much less stuff to carry. or maybe a robotic hand with
detachable parts like inspector gadget. someone once told me i
should have a man purse because i keep so much stuff in my pockets.
i don't think i can pull that off though well unless they had one
with pictures of tools on it and it had a cute little fur liner
j/k lol. when i go into best buy i sometimes get lost in time
almost as if i've been pulled into another dimension. it's like
electronic overload. i'm sure people probably think i'm on
mushrooms or something :-) but i guess it could have something to
do with me showing up in my green lantern pajama's and bunny
slippers :-) oops i probably should get dressed before i go
there.<br />
<br />
my hobbies and interest vary from time to time. i keep active by
bike riding running hiking and going to the gym. i don't exactly
love the gym part at least during but i love the feeling it gives
you afterward like now i can go eat that plate of fries mmm! i
recently got back into playing guitar and am enjoying playing
again. i'm currently working on a beatles songbook. i love road
trips and exploring the coast and just even seeing the ocean is a
great feeling. i consider myself a bit of a movie buff and have an
annoying penchant for remembering dialog. don't ask me how it just
seems to stick.",100000
"how's this for starters; i'm the most intresting man in the world.
i'm the man all women want to meet and all men want to be
like.<br />
i don't know what i'm doing here. hopefully i find a girl who i can
make laugh alot and likes to be with me and the feeling is
mutual.<br />
i mean how hard can that be i'm 49 i'm built like a silverback
gorilla i've got facial hair but i don't have hair growing out of
my ears yet. i'm sure thats coming soon enough. my 18 &amp; 19 year
old sons still live with me and probably will for a while. i'm not
a fat slob but i'm not ripped like i was when i was a kid either.
i've got a big hairy dog. if any of those things disgust you call
anyway i'm flexible yeah right.",100000

people seem to gravitate to me because of my sense of humor. you
will rarely hear my complaints as i am a happy person. i'm not
going to put a knock knock joke in here. i think you'll get the
picture after a little time with me. i am pretty even keeled and
patient - a lover not a fighter. i am generous. i appreciate the
same qualities in a partner. i like quiet time at home. i like
friends and family. i'm just a regular guy with regular needs - but
i have a lot of attitude. like i said i don't complain instead i
seek what suits me...<br />
<br />
i'm not really into monday night football or watching a lot of
sports. i do jump on the bandwagon late. the whole giants winning
season was fun to follow on and off the field. you're more likely
to catch me at an indy music event or maybe a small art opening.
111 minna can be fun! &nbsp;i like good food! i'll try almost
anything.<br />

"hy there!! i am new to the area recently moved to san francisco
from honduras central america and really liked the whole change in
culture and lifestye compared to the caribbean currently im in the
process of opening up a bussinness in the bay area and hoping to be
successful with it.",100000
"i absolutely love what i am doing and think the best is yet to
come. i am looking to compliment my quirky optimistic witty
humorous and sometimes eccentric persona with someone who posses
the same traits. someone who is intellectually curious doesn't
take herself too seriously humorous and knows what she wants and
strives to get it.",100000
"i actually think the ""personality"" tab does a very good job of
summing me up surprisingly.<br />
<br />
i feel like i'm an interesting amalgam of dichotomies. a computer
programmer who has studied massage therapy is an infj and has
somatic presence. a rational thinker who has done energy work on
people; a sensitive soul who believes that feelings don't always
trump logic; a straight man that feels that gender doesn't matter
all that much.<br />
<br />
lived in upstate ny all my life until a bit more than a year ago.
after a series of maybe not-too-concidental events i basically got
moved to the bay area. it fits me perfectly - all the different
feels the different areas have (walnut creek berkeley oakland
sf) match the vibrancy and depth of my personality. i'm pretty
passionate which can be both good and bad.<br />
<br />
i work full time in san fran as a software engineer and excellence
is important to me in most areas of my life. that said i'm not a
hard ass - i also believe the quote ""anything worth doing is worth
doing poorly.""<br />
<br />
with regards to travel it seems that no matter where you go there
you are. while i believe that traveling can sometimes shake oneself
out of ones box i also believe it's more cost effective to simply
do something different than one typically does.<br />
<br />
i love trying new things... on the list (in no particular order):
horseback riding glass blowing sky diving para sailing hang
gliding clay modeling... i have a lot of different interests and
feel most engaged when speaking with people about things that
either of us find interesting.<br />
<br />
also i'm pretty playful in my speech; it doesn't always come
across via the interwebs and like to make double entrendes when
possible.<br />
<br />
i believe that one of the most precious gifts we can give each
other is presence and empathy and i'm a pretty strong advocate of
growth and spirituality.",100000
"i agree with you  pitching yourself in text is a drag. but let's
get on with it<br />
<br />
i feel blessed to have a job and career i love but i value even
more living adventures with a special person so here i am on this
site. i think i've got a good work/life balance: i love travel
hiking sports biking and outdoor adventures but i'm equally
fascinated by a glass of good wine conversation seeing art house
movies cooking a nice meal and discussing how awkward you may
have felt watching the latest ""curb your enthusiasm.""<br />
<br />
lemme see to try to balance out my daily work with computer
systems i spread my time across various endeavors. over the past
few years i've tried to pick up a new skills/interests. a couple
years ago i went back to school and took a year of french (helps
when you're traveling!). then it was gardening. and then cooking
(my lemon herb confit has saved many meals) while this year it was
taking singing lessons. trying to sing has been tons of fun  i get
to scratch my inner showman  but i suck at it. however i'll gladly
serenade you with johnny cash' ring of fire if you're game.<br />
<br />
i'm social and outgoing (guilty pleasure: karaoke:)) but favor
quality time with special people. a two hour conversation over two
bottles of wine with a special person is nirvana to me.<br />
<br />
that being said i feel recharged when i go camping white water
river rafting hiking and other outdoor activities. growing up we
didn't have money so camping was a staple of our summer vacations
and i have many fond memories from those trips.<br />
<br />
travel? i went to europe a lot in the last decade and can't wait to
get back there. the best part of travel is that it expands your
perspective and opinions. i'm hoping you can broaden my
horizons!<br />
<br />
as for you i highly esteem kindness loyalty sensuality class
culture smarts generosity affection brains savvy and
emotional availability. a woman with charm wit and personal flair
buckles my knees. i savor deep personal relationships and feel that
intimacy and bonding with someone you love are the best drugs ever.
i'm an affectionate man - if you don't like hugs and massages i'm
not your guy;) i love touch and need you to do the same.<br />
<br />
let's you and i get this show on the road!",100000
"i always find it difficult to start describing my character traits.
it seems rather egotistical doesn't it? yet i do want someone to
get a true sense of me and to know exactly what they are getting
with me otherwise what's the point of being here. so i am going to
dive right in and go for it:<br />
<br />
i would describe myself as having a big brain an even bigger
heart and a huge personality. in other words i am smart but also
very fun to be around and very loving/giving.<br />
<br />
i would never be labeled as shy quiet or passive. i'm more of an
extremely direct bottom line cut to the chase kinda gal who is
intensely passionate about everything that i do.<br />
<br />
i have no problem expressing myself and laughter is one of the
main outlets for my expression. my mother was hysterically funny
and had a mouth like a sailor and kept us laughing every minute of
the day even through some pretty tough times. thus laughing my
way through life's problems is important to me. i mean what other
option is there?<br />
<br />
i'm very social and love being around people. very verbally driven
but i also try hard to be a good listener - and i hope that i
succeed. i am one of those people who everyone comes to with their
problems and i in turn am inextricably drawn to trying to help
people and comfort them and empathize with them. it feeds my soul
if i can (in some small way) help to heal a heart that is
hurting.<br />
<br />
i was raised in an irish/sicilian household so i was taught to be
a pretty strong woman. fortunately i learned many years ago to put
aside the fiery temper that comes with that ethnic background :)
life is too short for drama or anger.<br />
<br />
if you can't already tell i'm fairly confident - but i can assure
you not arrogant. i have tons of faults and my fair share of
insecurities. but i'm not supposed to highlight those in a dating
profile right? that's what the joy of getting to know each other
is about ;-)",100000
"i always hate this part but i will do my best.... i am a paramedic
for a fire department here in the sf bay area i've been doing this
thankless job for almost 20 years and at times love it! i'm a
divorced dad of two that are what mean everthing to me. whether or
not you have children means nothing but i would expect you to
understand the priority. i enjoy spending my time with my friends
and do that as much as is possible and try to only spend time with
those who have the capability of placing a smile on their faces. my
musical tastes are varied from rock-a-billy to 80""s alternative to
amy winehouse and mr cash. i enjoy camping hunting and fishing
and do my best to get outside as much as i can.... as for the type
of woman i'm interested in; you should be a fun free spirit
non-judgemental sexy (if you think you are i will feel the same)
self sufficiant strong but soft and a bucket of unbelievable fun!
kinky is a nice addition! if you describe your body type as ""thin""
or ""athletic"" i most likely will not find you attractive. i think
a woman should have shape and feel soft in my hands. equally bbw
does not work for me unless you have a nice shape and carry
yourself like you know you are sexy and are comfortable in your
skin. the ""unsinkable molly brown"" was a godess because she was
strong and sure of herself! i hope that what i have said does not
offend anyone and i look forward to meeting you very soon!!",100000
"i always keep my passport updated...but not because i'm worried
about getting deported...rather i like to visit other cultures to
keep a balanced sanity.<br />
<br />
next up: sur americana",100000
"i always thought websites like this were for chumps that couldn't
find a date or too chicken to ask a woman out then i saw images of
a few women i know from around town or back in the days so i filled
in more about myself and every at keystroke i couldn't quite find
the right words to excuse myself for babbling. actually i could
swear i have already done all of this in my google account or with
other online social networking profiles.<br />
<br />
in describing myself i would reciprocally have to provide a
description of my perfect [or as later described a preferably
imperfect] match which is not what you might think. people judge
folks and i've noted that others have judged me; believing i have
to meet a woman that practices karate is by evening on the catwalk
runway and by day a corporate ceo. they believe she has to be 5'
10"" and be a former swimsuit cover model or she has to champion
some great philanthropy. on the contrary i enjoy woman that can
just be themselves and are comfortable with who they are and the
skin they were born in. she'll have the basic qualities and
loyalties however doesn't corrupt herself with self-doubt and is
consciously self-confident. she is likely as dorky and as much as a
brainiac as i however cherishes the occasional childish
moments.<br />
<br />
about dating: well we are all human and there is no need to
exaggerate subconscious efforts to impress one another. we are all
unique individuals and i wouldn't expect to find someone in the
world too much like me. if such a person existed - i would date and
later marry myself~!!! i don't know if i could nor anyone could
handle a mirror image of them-self anyway however having a few
things in common and being basically physically attracted to each
other helps. i guess what i am trying to say is - hey i am a guy
and my match would be a woman. and whether it takes a chattered
auto response jolt from caffeine at our first meeting over coffee
or tea or a flirtatious moment after wine long walk and a kiss we
can sort out the rest of our compatibility from there-in the moment
....<br />
<br />
this is getting really to be a long profile. i am sure if you have
read this far then you can understand....<br />
not to mention interested.",100000
"i am 22 and love to work out hang out with friends drink and

fiction sunday mornings with the new york times and exploring new

conventional and love odd or strange things. non-conformity is
good. i guess one might perceive me as shy at first -- i usually am
not too talkative when i first meet people but become much more
social once i get to know them. i suppose i'm hippie-ish. i have
at least been called as much. for some reason many people seem to
find me amusing. i'd say that most people find me easy to get along
with unless they are really dumb or are religious fundamentalists

"i am a 39 year old single asian who is looking to meet someone to
potentially establish a long-term relationship with. i currently
work in downtown sf and live in the peninsula near the outskirts of
sf.<br />
<br />
i'm seeking someone around the age of 25-40 with a stable career
or finishing their studies in college. i'm attracted to the
business professionals or those in the teaching profession that
work with children. i'm not intimated by strong independent women
especially since i was the youngest and raised by older sisters. no
preference really on race but i am not attracted to religious
zealots preaching or imposing their beliefs on people.<br />
<br />
i don't drink or smoke and i'm seeking someone who doesn't smoke.
i don't mind if they drink socially but i'm not the type to
congregate at bars or clubs. i am also drug-free and don't want to
support or deal with anyone's drug issues and watch their path to
self-destruction.<br />
<br />
qualities that would describe me are intelligence responsible
compassionate honest sarcastic humorous introspective quiet
mild-mannered even-tempered. i would like to find a partner with
similar or compatible qualities. someone not too shy who is
outgoing and charismatic and likes to be active once in a
while.<br />
<br />
i enjoy many activities such as hiking biking bowling dining
and just sitting around talking. physical and emotional health are
very important to me. a good match for me would be someone who is
emotionally intelligent smart fun loving honest sincere
trustworthy and knows what they want. good chemistry is important
to me but finding someone who respects me and who i enjoy spending
time with is my first priority. i live in the peninsula but work in
the financial district.<br />

can spend time watching full seasons of shows that i miss without
being owned by my tv. love the office. netflix is also another
great invention. i would like to meet a strong minded woman who has
opinions and wants to share them. being a smart ass is a good thing
and not a thing to be shy about. i am a fan of all the bay area
teams but not a fanatic. i open doors and walk on the right side of

day not just a day that i screwed up. i get along with parents and

lightbulbs with just a small step stool and get things off the top
shelf for you. you will also never lose me in a crowd. i am vey
easy going and i can suvive in any situation. i do love that eye

"i am a neurotic but mostly sane individual who seeks out what
fleeting moments of happiness life has to offer. i usually find it
in the company of friends a good and twisted book or movie a
decent cocktail or in my own imagination.<br />
<br />
my pursuit of this goal has mellowed in recent years. i no longer
feel the need to channel the spirit of john belushi in order to
have a good time as i did in my early 40s. my hedonistic pursuits
are now more appreciative of more lasting pleasures and i am now
more likely to pause and think about whether an activity is
something i really want to do.<br />

i like to think of it as midlife crisis 2.0.<br />

oh i should probably mention that my sense of humor can be a bit
over the top. measuring in milli-south parks i'd say about
1500.<br />
<br />
although beauty can take many forms i definitely do have my
preferences when it comes to what i find attractive.<br />
intelligence is a must. i'm not insisting on an advanced (or any)
degree but i do relate best to those who are brighter than most.
in addition to sheer brain power i value an
unorthodox/subversive/perverse take on life and the type of sense
of humor that comes with that mindset. above all please have an
open mind. if your religion ideology or laziness is reason enough
for you to steadfastly see only one point of view we're just not
going to get along.<br />
<br />
physically i prefer women who are solidly built rather than
delicate waifs or the fluffier bbws who have no muscle to speak of.
i especially have a thing for women with broad shoulders and strong
arms. maybe it's borderline autism or i don't know what but i
really like to feel squeezed when i'm getting hugged.<br />
<br />
then again maybe i'm just a pervert. i do enjoy some level of kink
(i am naturally bottom-leaning but am willing to switch). the d/s
thing does nothing for me though. i have no desire to control
someone's life and don't want anyone controlling mine.",100000

<br />
i am adventurous. one time i travelled a 100 miles in the mojave
desert on a horse and got lost.<br />
<br />
i hate crushing snails. when i see a squirming worm out in the
rain i like to pick them up and put them somewhere safe.<br />

i dress in random costumes and run around town. i think that people
wear costumes all the time. they just forget they do.<br />

i have an interesting collection of masks from all the places i've
travelled to.<br />

i believe that chivalry isn't dead.<br />

i love words. i imbibe them with more frequency than i do of any
other vice or virtue. i love creating my own little strings of
them weaving little stories and tapestries. though i am very
selective to what i show.<br />

i love singing. i have rockstar fantasies that i live out at
karaoke bars.<br />

here is some poetry because i think it does express myself:<br />
<br />
it was<br />
a long<br />
long<br />
fall.<br />
<br />
but as i neared the ocean<br />
came close enough to wave to<br />
the startled fishermen in their boats<br />
i laughed and admitted that even had i known<br />
of the many failings of fathers and feathers<br />
i would have done it anyway.<br />
<br />
my wings fell yes - i saw them hover<br />
over the tiny splash - but by then i'd been<br />
swallowed into love's eye the light i've come to see<br />
as home drowning in the yes this swirling<br />
white-hot where night will never find me.<br />

made a huge career move from engineering to biz dev and it's
working out pretty well. two years ago i studied in sweden where i
enjoyed the best seven months of my life. i am very dedicated to my

people describe me as the life of the party office or home. i am
not afraid to speak my mind. pretty open and known as great friend
to many.<br />
<br />
<strong>a little more about me and what i want:</strong><br />
i am looking for a rockstar girl to extend the ""fun"" of my life to
leaps and bounds (uber plus if she's a dancer). this gal has to
have the intelligence to keep me interested (i like smart girls).
she's got to have her own interests and not just mold to mine.

sure to ensue.<br />

[a note about ltrs: i think long-lasting relationships are
fantastic. but i also believe that an overwrought search to find
one can create problems that can be easily avoided if we just admit
that it may not be forever. that way we can focus on making the
now--and make that now really really good. maybe enough nows will
connect together to stretch into forever but who knows? who really
wants to?]",100000

those qualities?<br />

charismatic professional looking to meet a serious-minded guy to
date - with an eye on finding the right man to love and to build a

commitment to a healthy fit lifestyle and admit a hopeless
addiction to the endorphin high and physical endurance that such a
lifestyle affords me.<br />

ok back to me talking about myself. i am an open book and am very
quick to open up to people. having said that i can still be
complex and do not feel the need to share my whole life's
story....but here is my life's story. =) ...(oh yeah i have a
horrible habit of using emoticons....i am not proud). so yeah i
was raised on traditional values but like to throw out conventional
thinking. you can often find me in the corner of the room laughing
loudly. i am jovial and i like to think i wear a smile well (i just
hope i find time to listen to what you have to say somewhere in my
endless stream of witty attempts to make you smile). i am trusting
sincere and ready to lend a hand. i believe you get what you put
into life. you know work hard / play hard and hopefully someday
work less / play more. it is all about finding balance and i try
to keep an open mind to continue learning growing. i place a lot of
value in people that care for others and understand what it is like
to care for or desire something bigger than themselves. i am honest
more often than i should be but hope i meet more people that can
be just as honest to me. i'm serious...where was that friend to
tell me not to buy that ugly sweater in 2010? what was i thinking?
someone should have slapped that out of my hand at the mall. hah.
so finishing up i probably read your profile and want to chat and
possibly meet up sometime soon. hopefully by now you like what you
have read and are leaning towards replying to my message. i hope
you do thanks for reading...",100000
"i am curious creative and i love being outdoors. i'm from boston
but i live in san francisco now and i love it. i'm a sucker for

you but here goes.<br />
<br />
if you are smart sweet and have a nice mug it would be fun to
connect. i'll take snarky too.... a somewhat underutilized trait on
this coast. i cook i enjoy movies theatre and jazz music and i
like to hike. why does that sound so boring and yet i cannot for
the life of me figure out how to make this sound more like me. ya

"i am from michigan but live in san francisco. i have lived here
most of my life. i love traveling and i want to learn spanish
fluently. i was really busy running my own business for the past 3
years and i had no time. i made some big changes in the past few
months. now i have time and i want to go on dates see my friends
spend time with my family and do fun things. some of those things
are going to movies laughing until i cry flying places going
surfing reading books on-line dating...etc...<br />
i'm fun happy fun to be with and cook thirty-minute brownies in
twenty minutes. i'm very open minded and will try anything twice. i
enjoy thinking deeply living fully and being in good company. i'm
not afraid to be controversial and will sometimes do or say
something just to see what happens.<br />
<br />
i also exercise my mind regularly through philosophy classes which
help keep me focused on the things i'm grateful for love and find
beautiful.<br />
<br />
i'm a great listener not afraid to be vulnerable and will be
fully present when with you. through trial and error i've gotten
decent at handling women's emotions and want nothing more than for
you to be yourself.<br />
<br />
when it comes to relationships i like the way the beatles put it:
""and in the end the love you take is equal to the love you
make.""<br />
<br />
you can be described as independent intelligent spontaneous
playful emotionally balanced open to new adventures and take care
of your mind and body. you have a great positive energy and you're
fun to be around. you are interested in the unusual and offbeat
aspects of life and can be provocative curious and original. you
have deep eyes and a great smile. most of all i feel really good

i grew up in small town india. i have very liberal views about
life.",100000
"i am fun fiercely loyal and semi-crazy with a lot of weird
quirks. i'll try anything twice. i'm extroverted (mbti: entp for
those keeping track) and would always rather be in a loud cafe
surrounded by people than on my own.<br />
<br />
i have a bunch of crazy stories mostly as the result of poor
decisions at the time...<br />
-being shot at in india<br />
-drinking the blood from a goat in africa<br />
-walking through the wilderness in zimbabwe after being given an
ak-47 to ""protect myself"" from poachers<br />

i am terrible with directions (even if i go somewhere 25 times i
still rely fully on jill my trusty gps)<br />
i don't like ice or any cold things really.<br />
i listen to songs on repeat for hours on end until i get terribly
sick of them.<br />
<br />
i say ""cheers"" a lot in many different contexts- (thank you bye

<br />
i am quirky but always entertaining. i grew up in small-town
wisconsin went to school in ohio and england spent some time in
maryland then came to palo alto for grad school.<br />

i love meeting new people and guarantee that if nothing else i
will be an entertaining date.",100000
"i am fun sassy smart inquisitive and love challenges. i am
ready to just have fun and play! i want things to begin as light
and playful and then we will go from there.",100000
"i am generally positive out-going and high energy but like my
downtime with a good book puttering around the garden or playing
with the invention of a new dish in the kitchen. i take my work
seriously and have accomplished a lot in a field that is relatively
new but balance in my life is equally important and i make sure
that there is plenty of time for friends and fun. my idea of fun is
pretty open  from hiking around a beautiful lake to watching world
cup soccer to small dinner parties with friends to hanging out in
the hot tub and gazing at the stars to getting lost in a small
spanish town and discovering a great new tapas bar.<br />
<br />
i would like to find someone like myself who considers life to be a
frequent source of stories for entertainment and insight and knows
how to find the maximum amount of humor in almost any situation.
i've found this whole dating after divorce scene to be a great
source of good stories. i'll share mine if you'll share yours and
you can always count on kids for good material. though i find it
hard to believe my daughter is heading off to college next year.
when did she grow up?!<br />
<br />
a taste for adventure would be wonderful. i should clarify
however that my idea of adventure is something like surfing (i
have pictures to prove i can catch some waves!) or traveling in a
foreign country without a preset destination a map or hotel
reservations. i once ended up heading a four wheel drive vehicle
into the middle of a river in costa rica on this kind of no map
adventure plan and don't regret it. given that i made it. : ) but
i am not sure i'd be willing to jump out of a perfectly good plane.
i spent a couple of years living in spain and still try to go back
there most summers. i'd love to find someone who shares an
enjoyment of cultural exploration.<br />
<br />
i have an independent business teaching negotiation and mediation
and conducting mediations and i love the flexibility and autonomy
that this gives me. the boss is very kind and gives me all the
vacation i can afford. : ) i have also discovered that i have a
passion for teaching perhaps because it is a performance art in a
sense giving the clown in me an outlet and because the subjects i
teach are rich in personal growth. i'd love to find someone who has
also learned a lot about good listening communication and what
intimacy really means either through their work or other
pursuits.<br />
<br />
other than that i suppose i'm similar to most folks on this site
who love good music dancing walks on the beach etc. just saw
norah jones at the greek recently and before that some fantastic
guitar playing by rodrigo &amp; gabriela (mexican brother and
sister duo).<br />
<br />
ultimately i'm hoping to find chemistry with a special someone
who has humor intelligence integrity and an appreciation for
redheads. if any of this strikes a chord with you please get in
touch. all the best with your search!<br />

"i am going to give a descriptive of myself for anyone that cares.

reason i am overlooked. i shout out at you telling you that while i
am not the most distinctive object in the store i am one of much
interest and value. the more that you know me and get used to me
the more you will adore me and be happy with your purchase. i am
very warm to the touch and can be soft and cuddly. i am also good
at keeping myself dusted off. lol so please the next time you see

good sense of humor. i would like to meet someone who might like to
learn how to salsa dance or rollerskate at midnight. it would also
be nice to meet someone who wouldn't mind giving my cooking a try:
i think i'm getting quite good.<br />
<br />
if you have an interest in someone sweet with many layers i hope
you'll take a chance and introduce yourself. although i'm fun and
playful i am looking for a relationship that is serious and
meaningful so please consider that. i hope everyone finds someone
special this year. cheers<br />

"i am originally from the midwest. i have lived in northern
california since 2000. i love this state and while i don't intend
to move away from the west coast you never know where life will
take you. i've learned it's all about the experiences you have and
the company you keep.<br />
<br />
i enjoy getting outside whenever possible whether that be taking a
walk down through the local neighborhood or venturing over to
tahoe napa or any other parts of this dynamic state. i'm not that
great of skier but i have a lot of fun everytime i go up to lake
tahoe even though i come home battered bruised and down a little
money too:)<br />
<br />
i have an awesome family that i live too far away from but i
communicate with them often and fly back to see them as much as i
can. i'm the youngest of four (brother and two sisters). we are a
loud bunch when we get together and you must have a thick skin
because someone is usually getting teased (but in a good way). even
though we are spread out we try to keep in touch as much as
possible and plan a family vacation every now and then.<br />
<br />
i consider myself to be pretty down to earth and laid back guy. i
try not to get too worked up over anything. i have come to learn
that trust respect honesty and compassion are very important in
relationships and are qualities that i would truly appreciate out
of anyone. communication is also huge in making any relationship
work. i don't play games and i think the waiting to call somebody
for 2 days and play it cool just seems silly. if i like you you
will know it and i will treat you the right way. i'm just looking
for someone that is ""normal"" has their head screwed on straight
and has a positive attitude about dating and life in general. my
biggest turn off is snobbishness. and if you are nice to me but
awful to the waiter that probably says something.<br />
<br />
i've read a ton of great profiles on this site. it sounds like
everyone wants to find someone that wants to go on a safari in
africa hike the inca trail go scuba diving with reef sharks in
fiji see the pyramids in egypt or have wine along the champs de
elysses in france. all of those things sound fantastic and those
are all things that i would love to do with a significant other as
well and nothing beats the growth you get from travel. though at
the end of the day i think the real thing that most people are
looking for is someone that they are comfortable enough with to put
on their favorite pj's order chinese food and watch their favorite
show on tivo and feel totally happy and content huddled up next to
that person. that is what i'm looking for too. if you have a great
family friends a career that makes you happy and a great dog
then that is just sugar on top:) i'm loyal and i like to consider
myself the type of guy that would always double back for a friend
in need. i might not get everything right the first time but i will
try my best to eventually get there.<br />
<br />
ok i'm going to turn in my man card now. maybe if i watch a few
hours of football i will be granted it back! good luck finding what
you are looking for.",100000
i am outgoing love to laugh and enjoy the simple things in life.,100000
"i am passionate about living a heart centered life. for me the
journey is everything. even though i am independent and secure in
my life i still feel an intimate relationship helps one have an
even bigger positive impact on the world. to me it's not about
finding my better half or some one to complete me but rather co
creating an ever expansive loving and authentic connection.
allowing each other space for our own 'beingness' and at the same
time coming together to manifest something bigger then what we
could have created alone.",100000

cooking. ready for a deep partnership of sharing laughing

a door and set a chair for you.",100000
"i am pretty easy going. certainly like trying new things; i have a
pilot's license but don't really use it. sort of moved past the
""wild"" side of my life a few years back so i am looking more for a
""settled down"" kind of relationship. staying fit and healthy is
important to me so time is certainly set aside for exercise during
the week.<br />
<br />
i'm looking for someone who has a silly side or at least could put
up with my randomness and lack of fashion sense. certainly a plus
to have a grasp on life at this point possibly having an idea of
what you want to do long term.<br />

i came here to get my head away from work and enjoy the warmth and
sensual touch of a women given i am not ready for settling down. so
just be semi-normal and we'll have some fun! i've had plenty of
bedroom experience but luckily played safe and am disease free and
hope the same of any girl i am being intimate with. so despite the
titled of the movie no strings attached is what i am looking for
at this stage of my life.<br />
<br />
in addition to wanting a girl that knows her way around the
bedroom it would be nice if you can hold a conversation and like
to be held sometime too. humor and intelligence would be nice as
long as i'm asking. location doesn't matter as i live near market

social events or go for a drive or a walk on the beach.",100000
"i am the oldest of 9 that's basically a crazy bastard version of
the brady bunch. i am super close with all my sibs and parents. i
was born in memphis and my dad met elvis. i grew up in waukesha
wis. where i had the freedom to embark on adventures that would
make parents today pass out from fear and anxiety. and although i
have worked hard to semi eradicate my straight white boy roots i
have maintained my midwestern values. i did a 10 year stint in sw
louisiana where i experienced major cultural shock followed by
transformative assimilation. i gained a modicum of rhythm two
stepping in honky tonks a love of all things spicy and i owned a
fighting cock for a couple of weeks. i built log cabins high in the
colorado rockies using mostly hand tools and a clydesdale. i
abandoned my overt hippyness in a cave somewhere above aspen. then
i moved here and spent many a night in gay dance clubs where i
picked up great dance moves and helpful fashion tips. i still love
to go dancing to whatever is on the turn table. i call my style
""homo hipster"" cuz it sounds catchy and gives me lots of fun
options for an old straight white guy.<br />
<br />
i'm a pretty hyper active kind of a guy who would rather stand than
sit. i'm in great shape from playing outside on things with wheels
that i have to make go and climbing around on stuff that my mother
always tells me to get down off of before i get hurt. i have
ridiculous energy. i am way more hipster than yuppie. i like the
mission more than the marina. and i think men who drive hummers
have issues with the size of their penises. i drive a
minivan.<br />
<br />
i can build stuff fix shit and look pretty damn sexy in a wife
beater and tool belt. i'm the hoopty king and can definitely give
macgyver a run for his money. i can take an old thrift store piece
of junk bicycle build you a sweet townie and teach you to zoom
through traffic without getting whacked. i have put on an outlaw
bike race series here city parks for 15 years. it's called the
urban outlaw cyclo-cross-dress series if you wear a dress you
race for free because i love irony. i was a bike messenger for fun
between corporate jobs. my tribe generally runs from mid thirties
to early forties. i still hang with the same people i met 25 years
ago when i moved here. i also ride and own motor cycles. i love
design and architecture especially modern or mid-century. and i
own a great flat here in the city that i really enjoy
transforming.<br />
<br />
i run my own construction management business but i have an
agreement with my friend that if he ever catches me in a pair of
pleated kaki dockers he'll cut my legs off. i was previously a
construction manager to the really stupid rich. now i work mostly
with non-profits building stuff like youth centers and reclaiming
forgotten inner city parks. i am very passionate about my work
even though it can be stressful. i even have some mad farmer skills
which i can demonstrate with my backyard vegetable boxes and the
shade garden i recently planted.<br />
<br />
i have a very active sometimes dark and completely irreverent
sense of humor. it runs in the family. but it's never mean
spirited unless i am in good company. i am constantly laughing my
stupid ass off. for the eehors of the world it can be a little
disconcerting at times. needless to say i do not take myself too
seriously.<br />
<br />
i approach almost everything in my life as an opportunity for
creativity whether it be clothing or building a bicycle. i fashion
""art"" light fixtures out of weird stuff. and i have few things
around my house i've done and i call art. i always have some art
project kicking around in my head. and i really would like to hang
out with someone that wants to create things together or do
projects.<br />
<br />
i am afraid to go through the caldecott tunnel. i don't want to be
captured by the republicans and made to patrol the boarder. i'm
extremely house trained and learned way more in couples counseling
than ""put down the toilet seat"". i was raised by southern parents
so i am socially engaging and have great manners that tend to veil
my urban edge. (hey i'm a gemini what can i say?). i'll always
open the door for strangers man or woman. and your grandma will
love me because i will take her to her doctor's appointments and
bring her flowers. in the same southern tradition i'm an
accomplished raconteur with lots of great stories that are about
95% true. i have a degree in english but i couldn't win a 5th grade
spelling b because i'm dyslexic. i love cooking meals with someone
especially if it's all romantic and shit. i am more likely to offer
to cook you dinner in nothing but a vintage apron than ask you to.
i have a set of very sharp knives and a cast iron skillet which was
the only thing my mom gave me when i left for college. i'm
currently in a 12 step program for cumin abuse.<br />
<br />
despite my sometimes jack ass demeanor i am terminally romantic
in very substantial way like a cross between the cure and keats. i
love making big productions out of the little things. and i believe
the success of a relationship is directly proportional to the
number of tea candles that you burn together. (i'm all about nuance
and ambiance) . i am a huge fan of communication and have
cultivated my feelings to the point where they are as accessible as
my iphone. i tear up way more than any grown man should.<br />
<br />
i am way more familiar with the cities underbelly than i tell my
mother. i fancy myself as a social sexual anthropologist. i
absolutely love all the various subcultures in the city and can
infiltrate them like a seasoned zelig. i like to lead expeditions
and i'll even provide the pith helmet and butterfly net. i love
underground subculture events whether it be art spoken word
performance alley cat races parties music burlesque. and i get
all mushy and horny after spending the afternoon at the moma. i
know where all the cool rope swings are in the city. and i can take
you to the coolest slides you've ever been on outside of an
amusement park. (i'll bring the wax paper). i know all the secret
trails in almost all of the city parks. i go on occasional dalia
raids in gg park when they are in season because i enjoy covert
adventures and having fresh cut flowers in my house. and of course
i have all the requisite backpacking bike camping and car camping
gear and extensive boy scott skills. by the way i got kicked out
of the boy scotts twice for what i would characterize as having too
much independent initiative.<br />
<br />
i am super playful uninhibited and i do not have a self conscience
or jealous bone in my body. i count an acute sense of empathy as
one of my best qualities and i'm one of the least judgmental people
you'll ever meet. i am flamboyant silly snarky sexy spunky
spicy sweet sarcastic subversive spontaneous sensual self
deprecating and have a thing for alliteration. i love to dress up
and i have huge costume box to prove it. i'm brutally honest and
ridiculously open about myself. i am definitely a glass  full
live in the moment kind of guy. i tend to enjoy the process as much
as or more than achieving the goal.<br />
<br />
holy crap! that's a lot of bla bla bla. and the funny thing is
it all comes down to one word ""chemistry"". mad props if you
actually read the whole. there's no way i could.<br />
<br />
i am sam i am i like green eggs and ham",100000
i am the opposite of awkward and have a great sense of humor!,100000
"i am the type to speak at an occupy rally in my air jordan's. or go
to the bar and spend the whole time debating singularity vs.
nightfall. or hold the door for you so i can get a better idea how
best to slap your ass later that night. two or three days a week i
eat only plants other days i eat bacon cheeseburgers. i ride my
bike a lot but i also own a massive gas guzzling 1970 cadillac. i
figure it evens out.<br />
<br />
can't stand mean manipulative judgemental or deceitful people.
and those who don't brush their teeth.<br />
<br />
i am a very physical person. that manifests in my needing to be
active in some shape or form just about every day. i kickbox (the
real thing) lift weights do bikram bike run hike ski...<br />
<br />
finally oakland is the shit. i'll show you why. if you still don't
think so it probably isn't meant to be.",100000
"i am tired of meeting girls at bars. i am just looking for a nice
girl to spend my time with who will want to come with me to the
bar.<br />
<br />
on paper i am what all girls dream about. i like to cook give a
mean back massage can fix anything and don't mind switching off
on chores around the house. i like to go out and see nature but
also stay in and cuddle. i'll listen to you talk about why your day
sucked and make you laugh when you are sad.<br />

most important of all: i have worked out all the stupid and
immature behavior you are sick of and have hilarious anecdotes to
prove it.",100000
"i am very upbeat fun and confident guy who enjoys making people
laugh and telling a good story. i am very close with my family. i
keep myself active playing softball golf tennis and taking a
sponateous drive in my old convertible. i take a lot pride and very
happy with my career. from concerts cooking to playing board games
and projects around the house i feel pretty well rounded on what i
do. i am a traditional guy who believes in being a gentleman and in
romance.",100000
"i am warm curious and passionate about the world around me and
the people in it. i love getting to know people and love even more
when i find myself surprised by what i see. i am very open to new
experiences and not afraid to be vulnerable. while i'm not
especially fond of conflict (who is) i am also able to speak from
my heart about what i feel and what is important to me. i'm
originally from the east coast and have been in the bay area long
enough so that when i go back east my family teases me for being
so california while here i've held onto a bit of an east coast
edge.",100000
"i am warm enthusiastic easy-going low maintenance and
attractive. i would rather spend my time cultivating love than
looking out there to see if the grass is greener. i've bicycled to
work for the last 25 years. when i walk i keep change in my pocket
for street people. i find humor in almost anything. i'm curious. my
family is hugely important to me. i am supportive caring and
independent with many irons in the fire. i love good conversation.
i'm open to most views (cause i think that there's very little that
we really know about most things) and i see most things in color
rather than black and white. i love conversations that take us
somewhere we haven't been before...... intellectually or
emotionally.....that is heaven.<br />
<br />
i participated in a mini mini mini triathlon this summer my first
competitive athletic event ever. i figure that the longer i compete
athletically the less competition there will be! i like projects
around the house and garden and don't mind going to home depot! my
ultimate goal is to leave this world a better place than when i got
here.<br />
<br />
in a relationship i have a lot to give. i'm fun truthful
affectionate inspiring accepting a good listener and a helpful
and considerate sidekick. i'm looking for a co-pilot someone who
can inspire me and someone i inspire... someone to share a private
joke with someone i can be real with someone who is warm kind
relaxed curious easy-going  likes making love cuddling and
laughing. it would be great to be with someone who lives a healthy
lifestyle someone who enjoys good food and wine someone who likes
to ride bikes together someone who is open and accepting someone
who wants our conversation to go on forever......<br />
<br />
i'm a little bit of a foodie. as my latest groupon offer says
""contrary to popular belief eating healthy needn't involve braised
tree bark or dining at a table surrounded by stairmasters....."" i
mostly eat organic food but not really fanatic about it. i like to
go to edgy new restaurants occasionally but not crazy...no braised
larks' tounges in aspic no alligator schnitzel ......i have been
part of the wonderful underground gourmet movement and now and then
like to splurge on high end restaurants",100000

cab rides that end with greasy food. sports are all good soccer
football basketball baseball in that order. college better than
pros. politics? sure. but i love discussing the big picture more
than small specific minutiae details. i am relatively liberal but
do have some random positions on many items. i am a confident

"i consider myself a dynamic eccentric young woman who is warm
hearted confident fun loving and has been known to ""speak her
mind"" (which has not always been taken easily however most people
who know me appreciate this quality greatly about me) i am a true
believer that we are the only ones responsible for our own
happiness! we are the creators and producers of our own
dreams...and dreaming in color; bigger and brighter is better than
never dreaming at all<br />
<br />
i believe our thoughts are our prayers and what we think about
consciously or unconsciously will become our present and reality. i
have a zest for life and love to travel experience knew findings
and live each moment in the here and now. i am a fan of enjoying
every single second and making every second count!<br />
<br />
i gravitate towards people who are are positive self motivating
energetic yet peaceful and intelligent. people who give more than
they receive because it just feels so good. i love to give
affection and love and love to receive it in return. i love
peaceful people who elude a calming energy who are kind and by
nature giving. i love a good sense of humor...largely because i
believe laughter does contain a healing force for the mind body
and soul. without laughter...we would be a pretty boring
society.<br />

i absolutely love sunday mornings and blueberry pancakes with
honey! i cherish sunrises and admire sunsets. red wine kinda girl
although whiskey lately has drawn my attention because of its
oakiness. i can't live without the ocean or a pretty scenic
ambience. i am looking for someone who can simply honor 3 things i
hold of upmost value! #1 and most importantly; 1. respect respect
for me and others 2. honesty and trust; let your words be
impeccable 3. someone who is not quick to judge or pass judgement
on others or themselves.",100000
"i consider myself as confident but humble at the same time which
sounds like a complete oxymoron. but if wine can be good for you

i am an obsessive traveler and get ""high"" planning the next
expedition (because planning is half of the fun). a wise man once
said ""for where your treasure is there your heart will be also""
and my treasure at the moment is racking up the frequent flyet
miles-- 40 countries before 40 and i am getting closer but there
is still plenty of ground to cover and having a travel companion is
a definite plus!!<br />

on a regular week i am at the gym at the turkish coffee shop
(philz in sf!) taking care of my family here and abroad watching
a movie downtown sf or wc cooking at home figuring out my
graduate aspirations.<br />

music is a fundamental pillar in my life and will never stop
""listening"".<br />

concerts are quite the treat playing board games is a great
past-time going to the beach is among my favorite activities of
all time. just got back from miami and spent most of my time at the
beach.<br />
<br />
running around lake merritt or downtown walnut creek is my
wednesday thing.<br />
<br />
i cook a lot and try to eat basic stuff--you know veggies meats
cheeses nuts fruits... all that but i do it so i can scarf me a
whole arizmendi's pie on the weekend or eat ice cream at mitchell's
in sf or have a half dozen pupusas (extra points if you know what
that is).<br />
<br />
i like movies...a lot...especially the good ones. i did a telemundo
commercial once and i am looking forward to doing something similar
again..speaking of great films: biutiful was the last one i saw and
it represents what most of my favorite movies are like.<br />
<br />
i am a bit of a poet and have written half a book based loosely on
my life which someday will be published.<br />

my favorite type out outing would have to start off at home or
friend's house we would acquire some nice liquor (i believe in
good alcohol for some reason----it tastes better-delicious
even!--no cuervo please!!!).... and i have such a great time making
people drinks and sipping on drinks that i've made before heading
out! then dance dance and party all night. if you like salsa
bachata and merengue we'll certainly have a great time.<br />

i like doing stuff for people because it makes me feel like i am
contributing back some of the bless in my life. cooking for people
mentoring math and checking people's papers are other things that
i strangely enjoy...<br />
<br />
i consider myself to be trustworthy and honest and i demand that my
match have this quality as well---this is non-negotiable. classy
ladies deserve classy treatment and that's the only thing i know
how to do (blame it on my mother).<br />
<br />
i will warn you however that i have an open sense of humor which
can be quite sarcastic and over-the-top.<br />

i'm looking for someone to have fun with no matter where we are or

if you're tempted to email or reply but aren't sure keep in mind
this story: i met the last person i dated out and about but we were
both on an online dating site at the time i had emailed her
through the site a few weeks earlier but she didn't reply for some
reason. when we met in person randomly she was smitten with my
dimple thought i was charming and better looking in person. (we
dated for over a year).",100000
"i consider myself to be a pretty open book - with adventure
creativity and humor on every page. if you asked my close friends
they would say that i'm one of the most honest people they have
ever met am a lot more vulnerable than i appear and will always
show up to theme parties in the best dressed costumes....hands
down. i am a midwest girl at heart with strong values for loyalty
family and doing what is right. however i thrive in cities with
all the diversity energy art and culture that pumps through its
veins. i have been known to grab the mike at karaoke bars and have
no problem being in the spotlight when the time is right. i also
know when to take a bow and let others enjoy the limelight. i
consider myself to be an outgoing individual who can be tossed in
almost any situation and stay afloat. i love to laugh and try my
best to keep people smiling. some interesting tidbits about
me:<br />
<br />
1) i have moved to boston chicago and san francisco all within 2
week spans and not knowing a soul<br />
2) i was a fine art major in college and still paint and collage as
much as i can. it is my true form of relaxation expression and
therapy.<br />
3) i have been writing my memoir since the age of 22 and have
completed 12 chapters.....will you create my fairytale ending? :
)<br />
4) i have backpacked to 24 countries in europe and have been to
almost every state in the u.s. my next stop is asia.....any
takers?<br />
5) i'm extremely ticklish<br />
6) my last meal would be potato skins and fajitas....you can take
the girl outta the country but...<br />
7) i am a master ping pong champion lol.<br />
<br />
i am outgoing free spirited and creative",100000
"i created the username when i was in brooklyn made a little more
sense then...but i'm glad to be back in the city by the bay (in the
herb caen sense...and sure journey too). i've lived in seattle
nyc and singapore great cities love to travel anywhere i can
speak spanish (other places too). but home is with the redwood
trees and the bounty california offers. when ""localvore"" became the
big thing in ny figured it was time to get back to niman ranch
territory. i'd much rather drive to the snow than commute in it
anyways.",100000
"i do love the bay area. having spent years living out of state i
truly appreciate what san francisco and northern california have to
offer.<br />

i guess i am somewhat of a throwback in that i still believe in
chivalry. i maintain a professional suit and tie appearance during
the week but i do enjoy wearing jeans on the weekend and getting
out. i believe life is too short to take so seriously all the time
thus i cherish having humor in my life.<br />
<br />
i have a variety of interests ranging from finding great
restaurants taking drives whether through wine country or along
the coast movies music catching a giants game the theater
concerts great conversations or simply snuggling on the couch and
watching tv. the list could go on and on as i am open to new
adventures.<br />
<br />
staying fit is important to me but i will still indulge from time
to time with a delicious italian pastry. don't let the age fool
you i am still youthful with a pension for sensuality and passion.",100000
"i don't actually believe we control who we fall for. it just
happens. i mean how many people have you dated that were ""wrong""
for you but you couldn't help it? or they didn't feel the same
but you still couldn't stop thinking about them?<br />
<br />
i can tell you that i'm a sucker for short-haired brunettes though
i've dated more blondes. i love people who are passionate about
something creative but i've never dated an artist. i'm driven to
do more and be more than a 9-to-5 drone and i'd rather try and
fail then not try at all.<br />

ou? you're amazing in every way. not perfect (that's just crazy
talk) but amazing. i find all your imperfections... endearing
quirky cute (for lack of a better word) and you find mine at least
tolerable. it's the little things that make up who we are.<br />

in the end though it's all about the spark and compatibility. and
those are tough things to gauge from a bunch of bad photos and
somewhat witty lines.<br />
<br />
some conversation starters: i have an excellent story involving
balloon animals have been to saudi arabia and covered myself in
marshmallows once (not all at the same time). i accidently killed a
frog when i was 10 and was once tricked by ninja raccoons...<br />

interesting facts about me""<br />

1) i moved to san francisco 4 years ago without knowing
anybody--just packed up all my things and u-hauled it here from
austin tx.<br />
<br />
2) i've written 2 really bad novels -- ""digitopia"" and ""the books

where i'm investing my time. i like to try new things... group
speed hiking at a breakneck pace a personal empowerment course
drinking a rosemary martini tiling the bathroom and latin dancing
until 2 am. on the dancing note i feel really great partnering
with someone who can lead. i grew up in wisconsin and we only chair
danced or actually stood up when we were drunk enough and it was to
something like ""shout"" or that meatloaf song ""love you til the end
of time"" or the chicken dance. i love it when someone can direct me
to a higher form of dancing i can be proud of rather than songs you
jump up and down in or have to get low to the ground. admittedly

watching movies working out and enjoying everything else this

and incongruous lists. i do not know my meyers-briggs type and if
i did i would lie about it on here. i like to dream when i am
sleeping and also sometimes when i am awake. i always obey the law
of fives.<br />
<br />
i am a great fan of contradictions.<br />
<br />
so i am not entirely certain how to construct an okcupid profile
that is as darling and charmingly eccentric as i am secretly hoping
to be found. (please do not tell anyone my secret.)<br />
<br />
i am not so sure what my favorite thing in the world is; i love too
much for it not to change based on mood. my favorite things
not-in-the-world though are stars and it's not even close.
people ought to look up more (especially in action/horror movies).
i try to do it frequently.<br />
<br />
so it turns out that saying a bunch of semi-related facts is not
actually a self-summary. i will now provide one: creative
intelligent unusual human being (not a cabbage in disguise) seeks
other similar human beings (not cabbages in disguise) to interact
interpersonally with. hello.<br />
<br />
(it is a day later and i am still sort of nauseous at using the ""x
seeks y"" trope in that last paragraph but i'm going to obstinately
keep it up.)<br />

"i just arrived from australia 2 weeks ago and would love to meet
new people.<br />
<br />
friends say i'm a gentle giant. i am definitely laid-back - there's
not much that can faze me. i recently missed a connecting flight
home from a trip overseas but instead of stressing i slipped off
to explore the city and met some great people at a cafe. i ended up
staying two extra days. i love to laugh (don't worry it's not
difficult to get me laughing!) and being fit and healthy is
important to me. when i get home from work at the end of the day i
expect to find my sexy girlfriend cooking up a delicious
incredible hulk-sized meal for me....just kidding. that'd be nice
but i'm perfectly capable in the kitchen and i make a mean chilli!
apart from work i love going out to restaurants having good
conversation spending afternoons doing sports going to the gym
keeping fit and going to the beach.<br />
<br />
i'm looking for someone who votes for things other than big brother
and idol - a woman with a sharp mind is genuinely sexy. if you surf
or if you'd like to learn that'd be great - it's a passion of
mine as you can probably tell.<br />
<br />
i believe that if you must lie lie in the arms of the one you
love. if you must steal steal away from bad company. if you must
cheat cheat death. and if you must drink drink in the moments
that take your breath away.<br />

car to the financial district each morning. nor do i daydream about
what's arriving in my monthly csa box while contemplating how much

the medical industry and i work hard to be successful. i'm
motivated by knowing that what we do saves and improves lives
everyday. outside of work i enjoy outdoor sports especially
snowboarding. i also cross-country ski hike and backpack and
dabble in mountain biking (read: i suck but try really hard!). i'm
now living in the presidio and i think it might be time to try
cycling. i enjoy being outside especially when i can enjoy the
natural beauty of the mountains or ocean or lakes. for regular
exercise i do yoga and run. i'm beginning to explore the spiritual
side of yoga as well and i find it fascinating. i love food so
exploring sf restaurants is fun for me. i also like to cook though

food!<br />

"i just moved out to san francisco and am looking to forge some new
relationships friend or romantic. i've been eager to move out here
for a while now and am starting to soak up as much of the city and
culture as i can.<br />
<br />
i'm very inquisitive and always question the way things are done
in search of a better way. i'm a scientist at heart and an
engineer in mind; i like the idea of self-research and digging into
situations until i know how all the pieces work...and then using
that knowledge to make something useful. this has led to a lot of
introspection over the years - as a result i understand myself and
what i'm looking for very well. this awareness and the results it
has led to have given me a very high though quiet
self-confidence.<br />
<br />
i'm also a very open person; i'll consider anything and don't like
the idea of taboo subjects. even if i don't agree with something
i'm happy to talk it through. one of the biggest turn-offs for me
is when people refuse to dissect their assumptions or beliefs in
the face of counter-information or argument.<br />

i've never been one for having end-all-be-all role models but
there are pieces of characters that i find hugely appealing. so i
looked through popular culture for people that stood out to me

here's what i noticed:<br />
<br />
male icons. representing authority command leadership support
and listening decisiveness even with non-ideal information
loyalty to one's circle wisdom and maturity strong and
foundational principles immortality (of life or impact) martial

i've lived a lot for my age....<br />
<br />
in the 90's==========<br />
my friends were 7 years older than me. i aspired to be a
tim-burton-esque ultra-modern sci-fi metropolitan artsy
millionaire. i worked 2 jobs paid rent and took ap classes when i
was 15. at 16 i gave up my scholarships to go be a squatter
anarchist gutter punk in san francisco (see photo). it was the best
decision i ever made.<br />
<br />
in the 00's==========<br />
my friends were my age. i started a fashion accessories line
selling punk rock stuff for too much $ to proto hipsters in la ny
and tokyo. i lost interest in fashion and took up writing
javascript and ruby. i expatriated to berlin. i partied.<br />
<br />
in the 10's==========<br />
all my friends are 7 years younger than me. i live in venice beach.
i self-identify as an anarchist. i don't pay taxes. i try to live
off-grid. i don't shop much but i do indulge. i appreciate the old
ways (like 5000 years old) more than 20th century life...ironically
i'm a technocrat.<br />

i came from a poor family and had very little opportunity (compared
to most americans which is of course a lot). i've never been
financially supported even though i often support 2 or more friends
in my apartment at any given time. i've never been showered with
affection or even received more than one birthday gift.<br />
<br />
i've been in a very special relationship with the same guy since we
were 17 years old. we have grown together and traveled together and
tried to be ""family"" for one-another. he understands me better than
anyone ever could and will always remain an important part of my

to keep the ship from spinning out of control or caring deeply for
a woman i love or growing up with the main character. i tend to
relate to characters in books very strongly and prefer books where
i share the main characters' values. i take notes in the margins
whether fiction or non-fiction tracking my reactions and the
emotional growth i'm experiencing as i read or making
cross-references to related ideas in other books or magazines. in

i love <a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=writing"">writing</a>. i
enjoy trying to communicate truth as clearly as possible to bend
words as accurately as i can to my perception of what's really
going on. writing this essay for example is easier for me than
writing a novel or short story. poetry sometimes pops out of my
subconscious as a dense and rhythmic encapsulation of truth.
writing a computer program which by definition communicates
what's actually happening somewhere is a beautiful thing.<br />
<br />
i love learning and thinking about the way the world and universe
work. for example i am humbled and awed by the fact that when we
look at something we can't actually see *that thing*. we don't see
the stars; we see the light that left them a billion years ago (or
whenever). but that also means that when we look at each other
we're not really seeing each other; we're seeing light that bounced
off each other's skin sometime recently. ""color"" is just a set of
chemical reactions happening inside our heads. and that means that
our eyes don't tell us the truth; they just give us a partial clue
about what's really going on. i love that! it says so much about
how *little* we actually perceive about the world and how much
mind-boggling stuff we can learn about ourselves. it shows how each
of us is literally chemically part of our environment. it gives
me a humbling and profound sense of my place in the world.<br />
<br />
once upon a time i was ""jamming"" with a friend: i was on drum set
he was on guitar. he started playing something catchy and ethereal
and i noticed that my hands and feet were moving almost by
themselves playing beats that worked echoing and complementing
the guitar without interrupting it. we bounced musical ideas off
each other like a dance like friendly sparring in martial arts
like a high-speed conversation with a friend; and the music grew
verses a chorus a bridge wound to a climax wound down gently.
when it finished we were both a little stunned and stared at each
other: we'd written a song almost by accident. sometimes stuff
just *works.*<br />

a favorite quote: ""confusion and clutter are failures of <a class=
""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=design"">design</a> not attributes of
information."" in other words: if you don't understand something it
is never your fault; it can only be the fault and responsibility of
the person who built or designed the thing you found confusing.
everything from a computer to a ballpoint pen should be as easy
to use as a light switch doing whatever it does extraordinarily
well and clearly. i strive for that in everything i write or say
or build. if i can save someone 5 seconds of stress i feel like
i've done a good thing. if i can design and build something which
feels so natural to you that you never have to think about *how* to
use it and just find yourself *using* it without thought as if it
were an extension of your own body -- i'm striving for that.<br />

i am not very religious i am agnostic so i don't believe that
religion can be proven or disproved. but i associate myself with

buy half of my cloths from the places that i visit so that on some
level that place becomes a part of who i am.<br />

conversations about the nature of human behavior and identity. if
you are interesting and unique you become part of my awesome
adventure for life.<br />

my friends are varied and diverse and scattered throughout the
world. when i travel to meet these far away friends i get a chance
to get a cultural inside view of the country - and get to know the
customs and see the different ways that humans interact. when i was
backpacking in istanbul i appreciated how men and women walking
down the street arm in arm and how they kiss each other when they
greet! how fantastic i thought! i then ask myself ""should i do that
with my friends?"" the answer was obviously yes! not all my guy
friends appreciated it though. haha just serious.<br />

"i love to travel to beautiful wild remote places learn new
languages experience exotic cultures &amp; cultivate friendships

enterprise internet entrepreneurship &amp; amazon
shamanism</strong>. i speak portuguese spanish french &amp;
chinese. i've visited over 40 countries &amp; traveled to the
amazon basin 7 times.<br />
<br />
while i love the amazon i don't want to run off and live there -
it's far too itchy and hot and there is no high speed internet.
but i've spent a lot of time with tribes in peru ecuador and
brazil and cultivated life-long friendships with shamans there so
if you are up for it and we become friends you might find
yourself invited to join in on a life-changing journey into the
amazon or another equally <strong>fun exotic globe-trotting
adventure</strong>.<br />
<br />
i am <strong>massively into scuba diving</strong>  and my passport
is always ready for an exotic scuba vacation to remote unspoilt
reefs.<br />

i currently make my living as an <strong>internet marketing
consultant for tech startups and sustainable brands</strong> . i
worked for several years in a f1000 tech company and am now on a 2
year sabbatical from corporate america re-organizing my life for
location independence. the freedom of living and working anywhere
in the world is appealing to me. i think a lot about ways
technology innovation can be used to address the world's most
pressing concerns.<br />
<br />
spirituality is an important part of my life and i tend to
<strong>resonate best with people who are actively engaged in
spiritual inquiry and conscious evolution while maintaining solid
careers</strong> . i have practiced tibetan buddhism and dzogchen
meditation for many years and yoga for almost 20 years. however
these days my spiritual practice involves praying with
<strong>sacred entheogenic plant medicines</strong> that have been
used by indigenous cultures for thousands of years.<br />
<br />
please note: i'm not really into recreational drug use using
sacred plant medicines recreationally or taking modern drugs that
were made in a lab.<br />
<br />
fun things i like to do include scenic drives road trips outdoor
music festivals rigorous hikes enjoying delicious organic food
and wine.<br />
<br />
i enjoy romance flowers and old school chivalry. sleeping in
cuddling and spooning are some of the greatest pleasures in
life.<br />
<br />
<strong>i'm here on okcupid to:</strong><br />
- meet cool guys outside my immediate social circles<br />
- find activity partners for hiking and rock climbing<br />
- expand my friend network to include more positive creative
soulful people who have shared interests<br />
- find yummy intelligent and kind men to date.<br />
- find my soul mate<br />
<br />
meaningless sexual encounters are not my thing. neither is
polyamory. so if you are cruising okcupid for casual sex or if you
are poly looking for a 1st 2nd 3rd 4th etc <strong>thanks for
visiting but please mosey along</strong>.<br />

i love falling to the ground tears in my eyes laughter from witty
irreverent slighted demented f*ck the system humor. slapstick
humor doesn't really do it for me. people who don't have a lot of
depth a strong ""higher purpose"" in life and / or don't get british
humor might see me as serious or intense.<br />

however the people closest to me know me as a <strong>low
maintenance friend</strong> who really just wants to chill out
(unless i am in the middle of a product launch) and have a great
time.<br />

sure i'm different. i may not be as much of a jock like

handsome as ""prettyboyluke"" on the page right next to me. (names
made up to protect the innocent and by innocent i mean me) but if
they're such amazing fellows why are they on this web site? they
all don't poo rainbows and pee sunshine! i mean c'mon they must
either be lying about how great they are or they have really poor
social skills.<br />

so i'm not going to focus on all my positives like everyone else

humor laid-back attitude mind-blowing sex great cooking and

about themselves because i don't read them being a straight guy
and all. but i'm right aren't i? if you want to know what's
different about me than every other guy here you need to know much
more that the ""good"" things...<br />

well let me tell you some things about me i seriously doubt the
other guys are posting: i can spend all day surfing the web and

way - in a bad way like when i'm supposed to be actually working.
i have two personalities - one that wants to lose weight and look
great for that perfect girl i anticipate meeting here and another
one who wants that cheezeburger over there. no that other one with
bacon on it! these two guys fight every day. the cheezeburger guy
hates the time we spend on the treadmill each morning and the
treadmill guy hates going through the taco bell drive thru at 1:30
in the morning after a friday night at the bars. they fight
constantly! i hate strangers but i really like people i know. i
despise reality tv shows but i tivo every episode of hell's
kitchen. i make sure i get the bus transfer and save $1.50 while
i'm taking the bus to go buy a $1800 bicycle. i wear brown shoes
with black pants. i check my email every five minutes. i use
prepositional phrases to end my sentences with. i put too much dill
in my tzatziki sauce when making gyros. i have phobias. one of the
worst is that i'll drop my keys down a sewer drain. every time i'm
leaving a store with my keys in hand i walk around sewers leaving
at least five feet clearance. see? stupid stuff like that.<br />

fun unexpected things and fascinated by the process of creating

my friends would say i have a pretty addictive personality. when i
discover something i like i go all out! my work is pretty
exhausting and leaves me with little to no spare time so i value
whatever time i actually get. when i'm free stuff i do includes:
catching concerts at the park trying new restaurants running my
dog cooking working out watching sports and martial arts
tricking.<br />

of reality but nevertheless here's what i think about
myself:<br />
<br />
i come here with very serious intentions and a very positive
outlook on life. i'm not only a romantic and an optimist but also
an aspiring pilot and at times a poet. i think to love and be
loved is the greatest treasure we are given on this earth. life is
meant to be beautiful and abundant and we in turn need to give
back to it only joy happiness and positive emotions.<br />
<br />
i enjoy city life - exhibits events theater musicals as well as
relaxing with a glass of wine in a cafe and people watching. i
enjoy traveling whether it be morocco mendocino or miami - let's
go! i enjoy and very much value spending time with my friends and
those close to me.<br />
<br />
in a relationship i am looking for an emotional and intimate
connection. something simple like touching and caressing can be a
very sensual and affectionate expression of love. i am looking for
someone who is energetic and enthusiastic about a romantic
relationship -- don't let love wither away! it is a flame that
needs to be maintained if it is to survive and thrive. also looking
for someone who can communicate intimately and candidly without
putting up emotional barriers. in my opinion respect mutual
understanding and communication are three things that all
relationships require to survive.<br />

i can write many things about myself but every person sees me from
a different angle. see me from yours and see what you think!",100000
"i realize this profile is an important part of the process but i'm
not really into it. so i guess the first thing you need to know
about me is that i'm not into talking about myself. i moved to the
bay area from michigan 15 years ago. i'm easy-going and honest dry
wit with sarcastic overtones. comfortable in my own skin. love a
good intellectual discussion. i have a lot of smart friends that i
learn from. i like being single but it doesn't compare to having
someone to share laughs and challenges. being independent while
together feels right. sharing a knowing look across the room at a
dinner party tells the other that there's a good story to share
later. i appreciate strong women and find some of the strongest
don't always feel it themselves. i tend to adapt and adjust when
things aren't going as planned. life is interesting enough there's
no need to manufacture drama. i once went a year where i didn't buy
beer and only drank from what i'd made. i'm not obsessed with
sports but i love baseball and hockey and know i can convince you
why they are so great if you don't yet agree. i'm just looking for
someone who is funny smart and beautiful. is that too much to ask?",100000

"i suppose i should update this but i don't suspect i've changed
much but my location. i recently abandoned chicago for the bay
area. i keep a visiting position at northwestern so i'm not
utterly bereft of vicious midwestern weather malort or all the
other things that make the white city fantastic.<br />
<br />
in the meantime i'm hoping this isn't such a bad way to meet
people in perpetually pleasant california.<br />
<br />
here's the basics:<br />
my doctorate's in computer science but i'm a statistician and an
augur at heart.<br />
<br />
i've worked on a lot of stuff: public health social networks
robots radios. i've done this in big us cities and poor-as-hell
central american backwaters. sometimes i think i prefer the
backwaters.<br />
<br />
i've got a smart little dog that i rescued.<br />
<br />
i'm really just looking for a good partner.",100000
"i take great care of my mind-body and spirit and would like to find
someone who shares my values. i love hiking dancing going to
great restaurants movies museums theater and much more!<br />
i have very strong needs for passion sensuality and intellectual
stimulation.<br />
<br />
i am fun creative and compassionate",100000
"i take pride in the fact that i am an individual not trying to be
a leader but purposely not trying to follow. i believe you can
judge a persons character by their willingness to display
cheerfulness in the face of adversity. sometimes the more things
hurt the harder i want to laugh. i like nice things quality
things they can be inexpensive but they can't be cheap. i believe
that each moment is precious and we all should value our time as
such. if today wasnt better than yesterday i want to know why
&amp; do what i can to make sure tomorrow is better",100000
"i talk openly about myself which you may find extremely refreshing
or quite uncomfortable. i am a good storyteller.<br />
<br />
i surround myself with funny people and like to be involved with
all walks of life. most of my friend groups don't like my other
friend groups.<br />
despite often not thinking before i speak most things work out
fine for me. according to my friends i am the dumbest smart person
you will ever meet.<br />
<br />
i flew 286000 miles in 2010 and am constantly on planes. i spent
140 days in asia last year. i plan to travel far less this year
because too much travel tolls the soul and so far it has gone to
plan. my favorite cities are seoul tokyo singapore tel-aviv
zurich quito san francisco and los angeles. i will go through
excruciating complexity to get to the airport for as cheap as
possible and then fly first class on frequent flyer miles.<br />
<br />
i made the buttons on the iphone 4 (and no not the touchscreen
buttons). i love my job. i can write emails at warp speed.<br />
<br />
i just moved to sf and love it! my room small but cute.<br />
<br />
i feel bad that there is little equality in this world and terrible
that humans are destroying the environment. i think one day i will
do some good work to help solve these impending issues.",100000
"i teach stagecraft and i am currently involved with restarting a
twenty-year defunct drama department from scratch at a jc south of
the city. before i started teaching i spent fifteen years in the
live entertainment industry (theatre) from summer stock to
broadway. a lot of that time was spent as a lighting electrician
designer and even some time as an audio engineer but mostly as a
technical director or a production manager. however my discipline
of choice through the years has been carpentry and set design. i'm
an artist at heart and designing for the stage gives me the ability
to express myself through what is essentially; large functional
interactive sculpture.<br />
<br />
when i'm not at work i'm at home in soma painting sketching
creating looking for inspiration from within or from others.<br />
<br />
sometimes when the mood catches me i'm playing along to my
favorite music... with my saxophone in the theatre or my
harmonicas in my car. i'm not trying to impress anyone with my
musical talent... there's a reason i do it alone.<br />
<br />
i've built most of my furniture (from scratch... not from an ikea
box)<br />
<br />
i'm looking for friends inspiration new perspectives. i'm an
intelligent recovering cynic. i seem to see more of the lighter
side of life the older i get. living in my favorite city in the
world and listening to the stephanie miller show every morning
definitely helps. i love my apartment (no matter what the weather
is like over the rest of the city the sun always seems to shine in
soma) and i'm walking distance from almost anywhere in downtown san
francisco.<br />
<br />
i'm not really in the market to date anyone having just removed
myself from a relationship that should not have lasted as long as
it did. but i'm not completely opposed to the notion as i've
learned in life to keep an open mind.<br />
<br />
oh yeah... my name isn't really seymore.",100000
"i tend to ramble and i'll go into my interests in a moment but
before you get bored i wanted to stress a bit about my character.
i am a true believer in the power of community and i posses a deep
love for my common man. this is part of the reason i am a teacher.
i believe in what i am doing with my life. i'm grounded. i'm
self-aware. i don't get hung up on very much. i'm earnest but i
definitely don't take myself seriously. i've very aware of the
power of ego in myself and others. physically and mentally i'm rock
solid. i can be a goof ball and i've definitely been known to
party but i am the kind of guy who is ready to be a consistent and
committed presence in the life of the right women.<br />
<br />
that was the important bit about who i am but here's some more
about what i like to do:<br />
<br />
i play competitive rugby i'm a musician a consistent and
open-minded traveler a big outdoorsman a current events/critical
analysis junkie and i do a lot of yoga. during the rainy winter
rugby plays a big part in my life but in the summer i spend much
more time with a festival party crowd recreating throughout
northern california. i see live music all the time and i will
definitely travel to see a good show. while i've played bass and
guitar in many bands these days i'm not tied to any one musical
project. instead i get my music fix by jamming with friends and
students and trying to improve my (not very good) solo
guitar.<br />
<br />
while i can be very into snugly couple movie time i am normally
very socially engaged and i hope to find a lady who is comfortable
getting out and enjoying the city hanging with groups of folks and
sharing ideas about our planet our nation our society our city
etc.<br />
<br />
i make the most of the long sf summer. ten weeks off from work
helps. last summer was a month in colombia as well as the usual
gamut of road trips music festivals backpacking car camping
wine tasting park time beach days street fairs free shows
etc.<br />
<br />
i am professionally successful but this is not the focus of my
life. if i had to name my life's focus it would be learning and
understanding the world/myself in that world. i've spent a lot of
time thinking about what makes humans happy and i've deliberately
constructed a reality that makes me very happy.",100000
"i tend to think of myself as a well-rounded person sometimes
goofy sometimes serious. i like to learn new (healthy) things
explore ask questions have philosophical discussions listen and
(try to) play music...<br />
<br />
i don't know what else to put in here i'll answer the
questionnaires and from there we'll let the okcupid algorithms to
figure it out for us... :-)",100000
"i think about math and i do yoga. sometimes and especially on
weekends i express myself through singing dancing writing and
improvisational mask work in the theatre.",100000
"i think how people grow up says a lot about them (although
interpretation can be tricky).<br />
<br />
as a kid i spent almost every waking moment on the beaches of los
angeles (you couldn't tell now) and i remember thinking ""why would
anyone live more than a mile from the beach?"" not to mention the
frigid east coast: ""those guys must be crazy."" but then one day i
moved to boston. and it was terrific! i didn't want to ever leave
(although eventually i was pulled back west).<br />
<br />
when i was young i used to read science fiction and fantasy all the
time. i was in love with the idea of magic and unexplainable
mysteries. so that left me with two career choices: (1) be a
priest or (2) be a physicist. since i'm jewish i chose door #2. my
brother likes to say that instead of reading science fiction i
became a science fiction professor. i like to stress that i've
removed the ""fiction"" part. i feel lucky because now so many years
later i find that there really is magic in the world and i get to
spend my time at work looking for it (at least when i'm not begging
for grant money but that's another story....).",100000
"i think i've got some good contrast in my life.<br />
<br />
yes i'm a computer geek but i'm very conscious about keeping it
under control. for example i have no interest in star wars or star
trek. the next stop for a geek that loves either of these programs
is hawaiian shirts and action figures neither of those are for me.
i also have no interest in video games. sure i've been known to
play rock band in a social setting and even enjoy it but i'm
drawing the line there.<br />
<br />
i live by myself and am conscious about what i eat. this means that
eating out for every meal is out of the question and therefor i've
found great pleasure in cooking. lately bread making is my
thing.<br />
<br />
for a creative outlet i usually turn to photography or playing the
guitar. lately i've gotten back into woodworking it just feels so
remarkably good to build something tangible and usable.<br />
<br />
however i offset the inside non-vitiamin d generating parts of my
life with some serious outdoor activities. my first outdoor passion
was mountain biking. cycling trips to moab utah got me into
backpacking. backpacking along with a move to california got me
into snowshoeing. next came off piste skiing. currently i spend a
bit of time rock climbing and surfing.<br />
<br />
my outdoor pursuits give me a perspective on life that's really
important to me. while these activities are fairly intense i'm a
pretty relaxed shockingly sensitive person.",100000
"i think of myself as adventures friendly outgoing warm
optimistic energetic and caring person who enjoys the company of
others. i am a good listener and feel comfortable sharing my
feelings ideas goals and hopes.<br />
i value integrity honesty kindness commitment compassion
charity dedication and humor have a passion and appreciation for
how wonderful life is. i strive for a healthy balanced life style
both physically and emotionally believe in hard work commitment
love and living life to ones fullest potential.",100000
"i think so brain but me and pippi longstocking? how would the
kids turn out?<br />
<br />
horseshoes and hand grenades if you're wondering.<br />
<br />
i'm versatile and capable a skeptic but not a cynic: a fixer not
a fighter mostly. i don't always feel that the glass is half full
rather than half empty but that's what i steer towards.<br />
<br />
i was born and raised in a foreign country that just happens to be
this one; my parents are from the side of the world opposite
oakland california.<br />
<br />
as my father likes to repeat endlessly i come from a proletarian
outfit. i'm mostly mid-brow but i can do low. high-brow: not so
much though i really enjoy the food. and sailboats.<br />
<br />
politically i'm combination of social libertarian and borderline
economic socialist. i'll take service over advocacy and only very
small helpings of militance. i had my fill growing up.<br />
<br />
i've been riding motorcycles since i was eighteen. back then i
couldn't afford a good bike so i spent a lot of time fixing them.
i'm really good at it. i'm past the phase where i had to go really
fast everywhere but once in a while i like to go ride in the
dirt.<br />
<br />
i had blue hair for about seven years. i don't really fly the freak
flag any more but it's still reflected in my friends - a pretty
odd bunch.<br />
<br />
i have been to the big dirt rave but somehow missed it for the
last ten years in a row. i guess i'd go again but there are many
things ahead of it on my list. that said if you magically found
yourself at burning man and couldn't any have fun you a) weren't
looking hard enough or b) forgot your earplugs.",100000
"i think the #1 thing that people want to know is ""why are you
here?"". here is my story: i moved to sf a few months ago to build
up a new office. tech world takes a lot of hours and i love my
job.<br />
so instead of relying on spending my little free time at the bars i
figured i'd check out okc.<br />
<br />
i am a very social person and i love hanging with my friends. i
grew up in europe and was fortunate enough to travel to about 20
countries around the world. brazil austria and greece being my top
picks.<br />
<br />
i like playing sports and fitness is a big deal for me. throughout
my life i was on basketball teams boxing team and i currently play
soccer and snowboard for fun. since i moved to sf i started playing
tennis (there is a court in my building).",100000
"i think these blurbs are impossible to write and highly amusing at
the same time.<br />
<br />
my life story? grew up in l.a. but shudder at the thought of
living there again. my parents are originally from india. which i
guess makes me a 2nd generation american. so if you want to learn
everything about me you can probably just pick up an amy tan
novel. went to college in the bay area. and after stints living in
boston london switzerland and south africa i am happy to call
sf my home even though my desire to travel and live in other
places remains unsatiated.<br />
<br />
as for things i enjoy... the list is long and eclectic. i'm a
cleantech entrepreneur who loves his job. (which is a polite way of
saying it takes far too much of my attention.) i am also a
dedicated athlete. i play ultimate frisbee on a local club team. in
general i spend most of my time active and outside either playing
frisbee running biking backpacking or just sitting at outdoor
coffee shops. other things i love...spicy food all-consuming
books dancing indy movies live music with a beat woodworking...
and about a hundred other things.<br />
<br />
i believe in challenging my own perspective on things... mostly
through new experiences. i have been blessed with the opportunity
to live and work in many places and in many contexts. i live pretty
intensely and i love what i do. but i also love the time i spend
relaxing with friends or exploring the sf bookstore circuit. if
that sound like your cup of tea i look forward to hearing from
you.",100000
"i think you and i are one in the same but at the same time totally
different. we both have hearts of gold and are passionate about the
people and causes we care about. we appreciate life and all that is
around us. we realize how lucky we are to have the lives that we
do. to have people around us who love and care for us. to live in a
place so beautiful we are lucky. giving back is something we don't
think about doing we just do it.<br />
<br />
we may play tennis ride bikes surf go to museums and art shows
go out to a salsa club hike off on some trail explore the world.
but we realize that while those things are great they would be so
much better together. even better is that we know the right person
for us isn't about what we do together and if we enjoy all the same
things its about being together. who knows how long we get to play
and be active. we both want someone we can stay up all night with
and talk about everything and nothing at all.<br />

speaking about night time. oh my god its 4am! i am going to
bed!<br />
<br />
i am goofy playful and loving",100000
"i thoroughly enjoy life approaching everything with hope and a
positive can do attitude. when i'm not having a blast with my two
beautiful children i'm most likely grabbing the gusto on a
surfboard a mountain bike golf course tennis court etc etc etc
mellower times may include a hike somewhere anywhere frisbee on
the green wine tasting or darts at a local pub. i'll relax
reading a book watching a movie or talking with friends on the
phone. i entertain often both for business and pleasure and
travel quite a bit also for business and pleasure. if you're able
to pack a bag and meet me at the airport on a couple hours notice
you'll have some fun!!",100000

whiskey and artisanal gin; a foodie that still eats instant
ramen... i gots dimensions is i guess what i'm saying.<br />

"i travel every opportunity i get by bike by plane by train by
boat. i have yet to go by space shuttle but i bet you that will
happen one day. for now i've been hanging out in the bay area
working on projects but i still sneak in a bit of travel when i
can.<br />
<br />
in germany i worked in the beer industry. go figure. then in the
netherlands i discovered all the weird places that not even many
dutch people know about. i also like studying obscure german and
dutch dialects. don't ask why i don't know myself.<br />

now i do the startupy thing and i'm discovering exactly how many
cool things you can do in life without bothering to have a college
degree. everyone there has a my little pony doll the cto handed out
on their desk. mine is rarity.<br />
<br />
i am a beer and food snob. it's obnoxious yes i know but you have
to draw the line somewhere. it's not good unless it's some obscure
yak's cheese from the himalaya's served with a peruvian wheat ale
with a wedge of lemon from morocco.<br />
<br />
i have an addictive personality; i'm addicted to spaghetti and
pesto. i will nibble on spaghetti right after it's cooked and eat
half the jar of pesto with a spoon. any dish with both of them goes
straight to my heart then my stomach then my intestines. the rest
of the story is rather sordid.<br />
<br />
i bike everywhere. it is the single best way to get around. i do
not entertain other opinions on the matter. unless you have a space
shuttle; then i'll reconsider.<br />
<br />
i love the rain. when i moved to the netherlands the rain greeted
me with one of the biggest thunderstorms seen there in a couple of
years. i had a loft bed with a sunroof i could open up and see the
lightening around me 360 on the farm i was living on. this was one
of the most amazing things i've seen in my life.<br />

event or places with someone who knows how to carry himself. i'm
outgoing loyal to those that i care about and extremely giving to

guy who is smart witty funny and secure with himself! i'd like a
guy who is chivalrous because he wants to be not because he thinks
i can't take care of myself and hasn't lost sight of the need to
play! i want emotional stability and the ability to be total geeks

butler and move to the states.<br />
1980 found me in houston tx living in the gay community at a time
when young men were being disowned by their families for coming out

attention getter; and quite new.<br />

"i was born and grew up in san francisco; i'm adventurous and
politically conscious. although i fiddle with turing machines for
shillings there are parts of my brain that are actively plotting my
escape and independence from this system of evil food distribution
networks and capitalism for instance this past year i've had lots
of fun learning and experimenting with fermentation. i've made my
own saurkraut kim chi pickles beer honey wine creme fraiche
kefir and cider. i also learned how to make chocolate and various
forms of herbal medicine including tinctures and salves. i'd love
to do more trading with friends and the community.<br />
<br />
i ride my cyclocross bicycle to get around town.<br />
i like fun rides on dirt trails in the headlands oakland hills. i
like attending the underground races like alleycats and cyclocross
races.<br />
<br />
when i had a small sailboat i'd sail her fairly often all alone at
night in the estuary and bay. stormy weather felt nice with the
storm-jib and the main sail on the third reef.<br />
<br />
i love to chill with my friends and make beer and mead while we
drink beer and mead. i often hang out at noisebridge... with my
hacker friends.<br />

oh and martial arts. i love martial arts. learn everything from
everybody all the time.",100000
"i was born and grew up in the bay area but my family is all from
utah  i'd like to think i'm a quirky combination of the best of
both of those. one of my personality traits is that i'm an observer
of everything. i love seeing new places exploring cities watching
people around me trying to see the ordinary in a new way. i think
this is one of the reasons i enjoy travelling and seeing new
places. i also love food cooking and going out to eat. i'm
slightly obsessed with trying new restaurants and with so many
choices in sf sometimes i have a hard time eating at the same
place twice!<br />

some of my other interests: i'm an avid <a class=""ilink"" href=

<a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=backpacking"">backpacking</a>
and <a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=camping"">camping</a> as
well; basically i love everything about the mountains. i'm an
aspiring photographer having taken a few classes. i'm usually
reading a few books at a time prefer movies over tv (although i do
watch a show here and there) and my netflix queue seems to grow
faster than i can watch stuff on it.<br />
<br />
i'm an introvert by nature so i can be a bit shy when i first meet
people but my friends who know me well say that i have a wild
side. one of my weaknesses is that i'm a terrible liar. my face
shows everything. i guess as a result i value honesty in the people
i know and meet.<br />

i am intelligent adventurous and optimistic.",100000

i majored in civil engineering in college (wait keep reading! i'm
really not that boring!). for what it's worth i sucked at it so
if you ever see a bridge with my name on it don't cross it. i was
a grad school dropout which makes me sound edgier than i actually
am. went back and finished up and started my own small company -
blinktag.com. left that to work in the valley which has been
interesting but the commute is kind of a drag.<br />

dad but then realize i misspelled it. it should have been spelled
""cleaver"" but no turning back now! my real name is nick. i'm not
worried about the beave.<br />

i think one of the nicest complements paid to me recently was when
a colleague at work said ""everyone who knows you knows the same
person."" i don't think you could call me a ""private person."" i am
pretty open by nature.<br />
<br />
i think i am intelligent honest respectful and sincere although
my sense of humor can run to the silly sarcastic or ironic side.
i'm politically progressive. i tend to over-think things but i try
to counteract that by trying to meditate (it's been off and on
lately). i used to go to yoga classes but now i have major
dog-guilt (i have 3). many nights i'm going from work straight home
to walk and take care of them. i would call my philosophical view
leaning towards the buddhist but i wouldn't call myself a buddhist.
i mean if i did not want attachments i wouldn't be posting
here!<br />
<br />
although i think physical attraction (hey i'm no brad pitt) and
having similar interests with another person are important in
relationships i also think that getting to know someone directly
is the most important thing. i think these sites can only be a
start. i don't think making laundry lists of interests and
qualities can substitute for getting to know someone in person but
i may be wrong - they say that these personality tests work
sometimes. but i have my doubts.<br />

i am a really really good jazz guitarist (if i do say so myself)
and i play around town now and then - much less than i'd like to
because of my day job. but if you're a jazz fan i can assure you
that you'd like my music even if we don't click on a personal
level. i also grew up playing rock and roll blues country you
name it and taught privately until i had no time to do that
anymore. but i also accept sit-in gigs for practically all types of
music.<br />
<br />
i love music movies books internet blogs hiking walking my
dogs at point isabel and tilden park eating out. i like talking
about current events philosophy movies. i don't follow sports
much although i'll watch the occasional superbowl. i'm not handy
with mechanical stuff don't cook fancy food (although i like
eating it) and will unintentionally kill any plant you give me. my
neighbor tells me gardening is a matter of trial and error but i
seem to go straight to ""error."" although i love playing jazz i grew
up with the beatles byrds grateful dead hendrix dylan joni
mitchell et al and i still listen to a lot of that music.<br />

i am new to internet dating. i rarely do ""winking"" or ""favorites""

parents looked like caricatures much of the time. my earliest
memory is waddling in diapers through the crowds at shows in golden

not republican.<br />
as a kid i was a nomadic sleeper. i never slept in the same place
twice. inside cupboards on top of washing machines under the
kitchen table. i could build a fort with a bandana.<br />
as i grew i began to question the mores of the world around me. i
decided early on i was going travel as far as i could as soon as i
could to see if anywhere else made more sense. immediately after
high school i left the country and travelled for ten years - fire
fighting the himalayas bicycling across the us food in asia
life in france etc etc.<br />

"if i had to choose one idea to sum up what i like to do it would
be exploration. i don't own a safari-hat or khaki shorts but i do
have an insatiable drive to try new things meet new people travel
to places i know nothing about and above all to learn as much as
i possibly can about everything.<br />

that may be slightly grandiose but the point is that life is
exciting to me and there's never enough time to do what i'd like
to do. i'm looking for someone who shares that enthusiasm and drive
about life. i'm looking for someone who is both passionate and
excited to show me why i should be excited about them too.<br />

sometimes you end up choking it down but it's usually worth
it.<br />

in dedicating so much time and energy to exploring though routines
are in truth harder-fought. i can get so focused that i have a
hard time remembering what else i need to do. in general though
i'm a big fan of the adventure-prone lifestyle.<br />

can adapt pretty well to different situations and people. i love
exploring new places and cultures and can't say no to an

sports. i am happy to be where i am though ambitious to scale new
heights. i believe in ""life's short. so just do it."".<br />

and rationalize just about anything still there's a creative soul
in me as well... well he's somewhat malnourished at the moment. i
like to think i'm fairly refined (i use big words a fair amount)
but there are too many situations that remind me of scenes from the
simpsons family guy and south park (really great commentary on
our culture). i'm an avid rock climber and scuba diver (former
instructor) so i like to get out whenever possible. i'm also making
good on my promise to myself to travel more. i was recently in
stockholm (sweden not new jersey) and i'm planning for thailand
this year (this time to climb as well as dive). i'm a kind hearted
guy with a slight sarcastic smart ass streak.",100000

wasn't in the plan. you never know what the day is going to bring
us. ""go with the flow"" is so important.<br />

experiencing new things and am willing to stretch reach drive

i bring a certain passion to life that most men lack. i have an
optimistic outlook and believe in enjoying the good things in life.

i will remember your phone number for 20 years the first time you
tell me it. any series of numbers for that matter. i remember phone
numbers i have not dialed since i was 8.<br />
<br />
i was outrageously hungry for success. san francisco has put a few
things in perspective for me. i work hard but i've learned by now
to enjoy life a little more.<br />
<br />
i'm in the process of taking back my career and life. all the while
just looking for some laughs good times and good people.<br />

i like spending a saturday morning hiking and a saturday night out
on the town.<br />

traveling is important and i do it a lot. even if its just a
weekend trip somewhere in the states.<br />

i love sports but geopolitics more. yes i'm an npr dork.<br />

that i really enjoy outdoor activities with my friends  hiking

to sketch and i usually have my sketchbook with me. i like to build
and create things without instructions.<br />

check out the soapbox car we built for the redbull downhill derby
in one of my pictures (its the tree going off a ramp). we won 2nd
place in san francisco!<br />

my dad was a pilot so i grew up traveling all over the us then on

favorite activities are cooking (especially italian) world travel

can spend more time doing the things that i enjoy and less on the
stressful things such as commuting.<br />

funny to write here any minute.",100000

i can also be intellectually grounded and rational as i often like
to hunker down and talk about substantive things with an engaging
companion.<br />

i croon a strong tenor can dance a nice two- or time-step am good
with pets and kids love both gourmet dishes at a fancy restaurant

down.<br />

just moved back to the bay area after 3 years in seattle. i've been
single about a year and a half after a rather long-term
relationship. i think i'm a swell date and i'm looking forward to

dr. john dorian. that makes me quirky marginally evil yet hapless
self-confident and constantly inside my head also a lot of the
other characteristics those doctors had.<br />
<br />
despite those many comparisons i'm not a doctor and don't really
aspire to be one. at some point my life goal was to get my
doctorate and make a good friend named james so that when he asked
me a question i could say ""dammit jim i'm a doctor not a
physicist"". that probably belongs more on the embarrassing thing
i'm willing to admit.<br />
<br />
i love laughing and making other people laugh. i'm pretty career
driven but i love making new friends. i don't really like writing
about myself and don't really believe that someone can really get
all that much from a reading a 2-5 paragraph description of
someone.",100000
"i'm a dc native but i've always had a little counter-culture to
me so i'm loving san francisco. i still brought with me my
dc-grown interest in politics and my undying fanhood for the
washington redskins. my future significant other will definitely
need to fly back with me at least once for a game (and probably a
little phish tour). the tailgate for the game alone is worth
it.<br />
<br />
i prefer relationships to flings and i think that at least two out
of three times cuddling on the couch with a movie is a way better
date than going to a bar and drinking. better yet let's get out
there and do some exploring or bike riding. it's such a beautiful
area and nature's way better with an exploring partner.<br />
<br />
i have an interesting dichotomy of loving being young
semi-counter-culture-y seeing live music and making a few unwise
decisions but still wanting a traditional ending complete with a
family a house a big yard with a dog and happily ever after.

drives to new places or jumping on the bike and going to the beach
in the summer.<br />

it is difficult to sum myself up in a text especially when i'm
writing it. all i can say is that i'm a big dreamer that is loyal
to the bone and a hopeless romantic. i'm always dependable and
thoughtful to everyone as long as you do the same. i do have a

book for hours on end. i like blasting music and driving fast. i
like going to fry's to look at junk i know i'll just end up buying
online (if at all). i have a lot of nostalgia for the video games i
used to play growing up and i have more than my fair share of
mario/zelda/final fantasy memorabilia. i like watching ninja
warrior and dreaming that it could be me. i like to cook i like to
relax and watch the colbert report at the end of a long day and
mostly i just like to take life easy.<br />
<br />
i don't take life seriously at all and privately snicker at anyone
who does. i laugh at my own dumb jokes but i'll laugh at yours
too. when i see or hear something funny i laugh way too loud and
everyone makes fun of me for it. but i wouldn't enjoy it as much if
i didn't. i'm not a big fan of internet memes but i love me some
delicious irony.<br />
<br />
i'm looking for a gal who can help brighten my days. i want someone
who is more than just a girlfriend but also a best friend. i want
to share silly jokes enjoy delicious meals and explore things i
wouldn't have even considered doing myself. i want someone who is a
good hugger who enjoys giving and receiving massages. i want
someone who will make fun of me relentlessly if i deserve it and
can take it in return. i want someone with some common interests
but also with their own passions that they can share with me.
mostly i want someone i can just silently curl up with at the end
of the day.",100000

travel. i love exploring around the bay area and beyond. i am a
very active person so i'm always up for something fun. i love being
outdoors. i'm easy-going. i enjoy spending time with my family who

talk and listen if it's interesting conversation. i am fine not
talking or listening--i'm not afraid of silence. i can be
introspective. i'm also outgoing. i am very empathetic to others'

spontaneity and am a romantic at heart...",100000
"i'm a transplant from the east coast who came to the bay for a job
and was pleasantly surprised by the area. i'm a bit of a geek who
loves movies books hiking weightlifting and playing board games
with friends. yes i like long walks on the beach trying out new
restaurants cuddling on the couch with someone special but
really who doesn't? that doesn't really tell you anything about
who i am. instead i'll write down some of the moments in my life i
remember best and let you decide what they mean about me.<br />
<br />
back east i was in a meetup group devoted to trying unusual foods.
when we decided to have a vegetarian meetup we held it in the back
room of a local restaurant. i learned a lesson that day: never
ever open a durian in a room with no windows.<br />
<br />
it was really unnerving camping out in a field populated by highly
intoxicated bees. the entire night was punctuated by the very soft
thuds of passed-out insects falling to the ground.<br />
<br />
when i'm really down i find myself singing along with washing of
the water by peter gabriel. it always seems to help.<br />
<br />
my friend marq and i used to eat wasabi tobiko sushi *at* each
other. we'd face each other take a piece eat it and see who
could keep a straight face the longest. marq's girlfriend would be
the commentator.<br />
<br />
sometimes when i'm having trouble sleeping i picture myself on a
roller coaster full of loop-de-loops. it usually works. (i don't
fall asleep on actual roller coasters incidentally.)<br />
<br />
you might not think cracked-pepper sorbet would work but it really
does. also japanese tourists on vacation in france look very
surprised when americans speak to them in their language.<br />
<br />
when i drove down highway 1 at dusk for the first time i put the
top down turned to watch the sun fall off the edge of the world
and thought: if all of the joys and achievements and hardships and
risks of my entire life have led up to this single perfect moment
then it has all been entirely worth it.",100000
"i'm a transplant from the midwest -- i've lived in california for
over 7 years and in san francisco for close to two. a fun time for
me is hanging out with my friends (i tend to prefer smaller groups

movie or going to a concert (although i probably don't got to as
many shows as i should).",100000
"i'm a transplant from your favorite meatball eating furniture

i moved to the bay area since if you're in software like me this
is the place to be. and there was a company here nice enough to
want to give me a job. (it of course also helps that there are lots
of nice people here no winters and a big red bridge.)<br />
<br />
a big interest of mine is music. i've been singing in vocal groups
before but don't do that right now. i've also been dj:ing and
making a bit of music of my own. one day i will pick that up
again..<br />

layover in the mountains of colorado. i loved my days in a small
ski town and often dream of moving back but i also need the
social and cultural stimulation of the city.<br />
<br />
a glimpse into my naughty side...<br />
i've smuggled un-pasteurized cheeses and cuban cigars past those
cute little beagles at sfo; the cheeses i shared with the my local
cheesemonger the cigars were gifts for my brothers. i also did a
little trespassing in hawaii once in order to visit an off the
map community taro farm. i'd certainly love to have you dangling
some treats to distract the beagles!<br />
<br />
i love to explore the world and dive into different cultures. this
ranges from journeys to remote parts of africa (timbuktu really
exists!) to wandering the streets of paris sans map. there's always
an adventure around the next corner and a lesson to be learned
along the way - i try to keep myself open to both! i guess my love
for travel and adventure is aided by my ability to sleep anywhere
so i always arrive well-rested and ready to explore!<br />
<br />
i try to live a life filled with passion and intensity yet also
savor a quiet night at home or a week of sitting lakeside in maine
with nothing but a stack of books and long walks to pass the days.
i love to spend weekends playing in the mountains or wine country
or perhaps lingering over brunch and the sunday times and wandering
the farmers market in search of the perfect ingredients to create a
scrumptious dinner with friends. my city time might also include
the symphony or other concert catching a speaker at the world
affairs council/comm club enjoying a meal with friends walking my
dog or volunteering.<br />
<br />
i had a recent ""adventure"" on my way to the distant wedding of two
dear friends. when i arrived (against all odds truly!) there was
a card in my room from the couple. the groom's comment was ""wow -
you certainly don't do dull!"" he's right. but it was so important
for me to be there for their wedding. my friends and family make my
world what it is and i would do anything to be there for them in
their moments of both joy and sorrow - and for the fun and
adventure in between. the (mis)adventure even led to an interview
on cnn. if you want the full story well...you'll just have to meet
me!",100000
"i'm an easy going fun-lovin' gregarious engaging youthful
passionate and adventurous kind of guy. i'm social outgoing
personable funny and can entertain a crowd yet enjoy my
opportunities to be solitary and introspective as well. i'm one of
those searchers or wanderers that aren't lost but rather found
time and time again. i like to kayak mountain bike fish
hike/backpack ski and prefer being active as a form of
entertainment. although i am an outdoors person and love most
activities around or involving the water i also enjoy relaxing and
entertaining at home as well. i'm into live music of all kinds
enjoy dancing and have a long history of ""gigging"" as i like to
call it.<br />
<br />
i say i'm ""bi-coastal"" because i grew up in the north east(coast)
where i maintain a strong connection and identity w/ the people and
culture but feel fortunate to have made my home here in the bay.
i've road-tripped extensively here in the states before arriving in
california but also enjoyed some remarkable international
traveling experiences like trekking in nepal scuba diving in
thailand and bungee jumping/wine tasting and two-a-day safari's in
south africa as well.<br />
<br />
i'm a born procrastinator with things i'm not motivated to do but
willingly jump at other activities and opportunities as they arise.
i speak my mind and appreciate others' perspectives. i'm honest and
forthright w/ myself and the people around me and direct to the
point of ""brutally honesty"" at times. i'm a good communicator and a
true conversationalist but if you don't keep/speak up i may talk
over you even though i'm a good listener when it's time.<br />
<br />
i'm a ""man's man"" but in relative balance with my more sensitive
side. you might catch me yelling at the tv while my team is
playing but i'm also considerate compassionate and very
affectionate with a lady-friend. i'm a non-conformist of sorts i'm
not easily intimidated i don't care much for authority and i don't
buy into what is often the norm in fact i'm almost more likely to
take an opposing viewpoint/perspective. i'm often spontaneous but
like to plan for others. i'm not up on pop culture and couldn't
care less who's on a reality tv show or what the latest trend
fashion or number one hit on the radio is - but it's cool if you
do. i like nice stuff but it's just that and i'd give up every
dime for a positive experience and a good memory.<br />

i enjoy cold beers dark coffee w/ a little brown sugar complex
rhone varietal red wines warm fires deep meaningful conversation
intensity adventure sarcasm intimacy thrills spontaneity and
""all things pudding"".<br />

i'm not an optimist or a pessimist but rather a realist. i'm a
firm believer in ""timing is everything"" and if ""a picture is worth
a thousand words"" than being a part of the experience has got to be
worth millions. i think that opinions are best validated through
personal experience or kept to oneself because they will otherwise
carry little weight with me. i'd much rather do it than read about
it.<br />
<br />
i don't really have a ""type"" but i do appreciate strong women that
can challenge and inspire me. someone that's explored herself and
can relate well to others and hopefully realizes that perception
isn't necessarily everyone's reality. i enjoy mature/wise women
that are truly in touch w/ their inner ""giddy girl"". i like women
that can take care of themselves but aren't too proud to be taken
care of. i'm interested in someone that is open to learning new
things while having something to teach me. we don't have to see
eye-to-eye all the time but it's important to agree to disagree
and be able to move on. i'm attracted to fun/feisty

minute of every day of my life. i deal with this through the joy of
music and the endorphins from exercise (pilates and table tennis)

edibles) at night to help me relax and sleep. i am off of
pharmaceutical pain killers as a result. but if you are in a 12
step program you might want to steer clear of me.<br />

i have enjoyed a fair amount of travel in my life but for the next

exit plan. so if you are one of the users with some form of the
word ""travel"" in your name then again steer clear.<br />

perfectionist but at the same time completely imperfect. i'm clean

could debate the latest supreme court ruling or speak of lindsay
lohan's latest escapades. i like everyone except for the people i
don't like. i insist on opening doors for women. i want to have a

indiana you will understand why i relocated - way too many beaches
and tourists.<br />

so here's the part that matches all other profiles but is none the
less true. i like staying active mentally and physically. i like
being outdoors riding my bike running walking around a new part
of the city playing frisbee soccer etc. i also like going out on
the weekends but enjoy a few nights in as well. i can enjoy polk
street the marina the mission and pretty much any other style of
night life (looking to explore). i think i am intelligent
considerate funny outgoing and compassionate. i like doing
anything new at least twice. i am an independent person able to
hold intellectual conversations and am too mature for my age.",100000
"i'm more complex than i look...i'm an open book:) i'm an engineer
which obviously from my biker appearance no one ever believes. i
have pretty much everything in place and i find that most women
can't handle a successful guy that is as independent as me as if
it's intimidating or overwhelming. i'm not from this side of the
country and i came from a different set of values and morals than
most of the guys in sf. sadly my family thinks its time to weed
out the herd and find if there are any good wild fun intelligent
and driven women out here that can keep up.<br />
<br />
if you cannot keep and interesting conversation for longer than a
minute on a topic that does not involve drinking shoes or your
make up do not even bother messaging me. there is more to life
than a night out partying :) hit me up to find out more if you
dare ;)<br />
<br />
also if you are insecure or overly jealous please don't waste my
time or yours. i'm working on getting back into my boxing/diving
body so if you are not at least a bit health conscious or make an
attempt to take care of your temple don't even bother. call me

it moving :0) i am not an a**hole i just know who i am and i am
not afraid to voice it.",100000

seem as a party girl when surrounded by scientists and as the nerdy
one among party animals. epicurean among yogis and an ascetic among
eccentrics.<br />
sometimes i go a far way to provoke and see how far do the limits
of people's open mindedness go. mostly because i don't take
nothingincluding myself very seriously. i'm interested in society

"im not good in writing so its hard for me to describe myself in
words. i would say i'm positive easy going can be adventurous
patient open-minded.",100000
"i'm not really sure how to describe myself because i consider
myself pretty unique and dichotomous. i suppose work-hard /
play-hard describes me pretty well: i take my career very seriously
(i recently started working in management consulting) but i'm also
a huge adventurer and willing (hoping?) to try just about
everything.<br />
<br />
i'm in the middle of my mba and before the mba i had just returned
to the us from a stint in the peace corps in central america where
i worked as a business development volunteer. i helped at-risk
youth open and operate their own businesses through a business
incubator started a recycling co-op in my city with a marginalized
community (i could talk about this forever) worked with hiv/aids
support groups around the country helping them with income
generation to help them support their families and helped train
women's groups in business skills. it was an amazing 2+ years and
probably the most transformative experience of my life.<br />
<br />
i consider myself an explorer and doer of cool things including
swimming the english channel and alcatraz and hiking a rain forest.
on the list of future cool things to do: hiking the appalachian
trail biking across the us scuba diving with great white sharks
hiking kilimanjaro and trailing my family's ancestry in the basque
region of spain.<br />
<br />
even though i'm focused on business / consulting for my career i'm
really into the arts and do a little bit of writing here and there
myself (mostly just playing around with short story ideas but i
have a few larger projects i'm working on that i'm pretty excited
about). i'm somewhat obsessed dante's divine comedy (and
specifically the inferno) having read it about 20 times and always
finding something new to obsess about.<br />
<br />
i'm also somewhat of a musician: i've been a singer for a really
long time and can play a little bit of guitar (though i usually let
other people play and i sing). i've sung the national anthem at a
celtics game and a minor league baseball game. the highlight of my
singing career by far has been performing in front of about 130
people in an ancient roman amphitheater in caeserea israel.<br />
<br />
overall i'm a pretty big goofball and i love to make fun of myself.
i love to make a fool of myself in karaoke i'm the guy being a
dork and having fun on the dance floor (though i know my way around
a ballroom) but also have an arsty side and love museums book
clubs ted talks npr bbc talk of the nation how stuff works
podcast stuff you missed in history class podcast etc.",100000
"i'm not your ""ordinary"" kind of guy. more than anything i value
intellect honesty knowledge curiosity a sense of adventure a
multifaceted nature a good education and an interesting life. i'm
eclectic intelligent passionate sensual and cerebral. i take
great pleasure in the unusual and the extraordinary. i tend to
challenge people and i like to be challenged as well. i find
mental exercise as important as physical exercise and the workout
that i get from intellectual discussion is just as exhilirating as
the one i get at the gym.<br />
<br />
friends often tell me i'm too much for many women to handle but
that for an extraordinary woman i'm the perfect man. while i
trained as an actor in my foolish youth i'm an attorney in solo
practice doing arts/entertainment and general business law. it's
an unorthodox practice; my cat lysette has her own chair under a
warm lamp near my desk. i work upstairs from my home in of san
francisco and spend time in the country at a family house in west
marin. i love the theatre and the arts in all forms and i love to
travel and to spend time with international/multicultural friends.
all in all i've built a pretty good life and i'm hoping to share
it with someone wonderful. i'm three years divorced with an
adorable 7-year old son.<br />
<br />
i'm looking for an extraordinary woman educated charming
intellectually challenging a candidate for commitment and a
family. someone who is strong and settled in herself who knows who
she is and what she wants. a woman who finds joy and wonder in
life who appreciates the essential humor of existence and who is
fascinated with every aspect of the world around us. someone who's
adventurous in all ways who's experienced many things and is
always ready to learn about new ones. is that too much to ask for?
i hope not!<br />
<br />
i'm partial to people who are multilingual. i'd adore a woman who
could converse in french; i also manage in spanish italian and
japanese. and of course she'd be an accomplished (but honorable)
flirt! ;-)<br />
<br />
life can be so wonderful when you share it with someone who's
thoughtful open playful and adventurous and who has a sense of
life and love as joyous theatre. in my book a truly wonderful
woman knows how to make you feel like her hero like superman
gilgamesh and oscar gordon all at the same time.<br />
<br />
a perfect first date would begin in the sort of place where the
first of us to arrive could watch the other walk across the room
be struck by their grace charm and presence and hope that this
wonderfully exciting person was in fact the one they'd come to
meet. it would involve cocktails and dinner good food good wine
a lot of deep conversation and an electrical charge building in the
air. it would end with a kiss that melted into an embrace that
ended only when we both realized we didn't dare let it go any
further not yet. and it would leave us both wanting more.
soon.<br />
<br />
no winks notice: thanks for reading this far. if you've made it to
the end let me ask please if we could dispense with the ""wink""
phase. i almost never respond to winks. i'm looking for a bold
woman who can summon up the courage and eloquence to write
something substantive. so please don't just wink. write something
that will get my attention. suggested opener: ""hi! i just read your
okcupid profile and . . . ."" the rest is up to you!",100000

spiritually i don't feel i need a middleman so i don't affiliate

i listen to a lot of npr read a lot of periodicals and live alone
in an apartment high up a building that looks east across san
francisco and<br />
burns the sunlight through my eyelids every morning.<br />
<br />
i'm a deeply introspective person. part of this is due to the fact
that i am a deeply stressed person (by my nature and career) and
the best way i counter this isn't going out and partying hard but
instead looking honestly at myself instead of looking at drunk
people in the marina on weekends. recently this has meant
addressing my sesame street attention span (google it) by
meditating (secularly) for a half an hour every day. it's amazing -
and i'm no new age hippie.<br />
<br />
i spent a year in taiwan between high school and college as an
exchange student. it defined who i am today in many ways. my family
actually moved to shanghai last year so the whole ""china's going

i think of myself as easy going and analytical (the virgo in me). i
have an interest in architectural history (art deco and googie)
photography waterfalls (i grew up near the ocean) and exploring
museums and old bookstores stores. i had a cute dog and pet rabbit
as a kid and now have a small saltwater aquarium with a clownfish
cleaner shrimp and 6 line wrasse - they seem to get along but
would you believe the clownfish bites...<br />
<br />
i'm an okay cook - fowl and seafood only but dine out several
times a week usually somewhere on college ave or sf. my musical
taste are a bit eclectic - and still lean towards old college
alternative days and u2 (grew up listing to kroq ""rock of the 80s""
in la). i enjoy giving massages with soothing new age music in the
background and scented candles setting a relaxing mood. i like to
travel and have been to europe several times. i'd really would like
to visit japan soon.<br />

so what am i looking for... i think that my type is someone that is
comfortable in their own skin easy going a playful spirit
confident not into drama likes to explore... someone that likes
to take a detour down an old street that they've never been on just
to find out what is there... a very nice smile is also
desirable.<br />

at home in a suit as i am in jeans. board rooms and walks across
sandy beaches or grassy meadows - love them both.<br />

if you're a romantic that's such a plus. i saw a couple running
through the rain today arm and arm laughing dashing for cover.
when they reached a dry spot they looked at each other smiled
and kissed with such passion i felt a bit embarrassed observing

in my life where i'd definitely enjoy settling down with that
special someone. i would characterize myself as a relatively
outgoing and social person i enjoy long chats with good friends as
well as meeting new people and i am always up for a new adventure.
i think of myself as grounded laid back and down-to-earth though
i have a passionate and sensitive side under the surface.<br />
despite the fact that i'm a scientist by profession i would also
consider myself artistically-inclined; for example i like to play
the piano in my spare time. i also put a premium on staying active
and physically fit and i like to spend a lot of time outdoors. i
have been playing tennis since i was young (used to coach summer
tennis leagues) and i still play as often as possible. in the
evenings i like dining out and experiencing new restaurants in the

catching a film.<br />

i didn't grow up with lots of money so i even though i make a good
living i don't think i could ever be a snob. i do love gourmet
food and trying new foods i've never had before but i'll

can't stand people who say ""i don't even own a tv.""<br />

"i'm pretty easy going. i grew up in the central prairies of canada
though i was a city boy i had a fair amount of small-town life
growing up. so i tend to appreciate the simpler things of life:
i'd rather ride my bike or hike for exercise than hop on a
treadmill. cars are useful now and then but i love riding the
trains around town. texting has its uses but i'd rather hear your
voice or better yet see your eyes crinkle at my lame jokes in
person. i don't really care too much what i am doing as long as i
am with good people. though i have a curious mind and like to
learn about new things and hear new perspectives. i tend to like
music/film/art that is stirring and has a lot of tension to it. on
the flip side i like my actual life to be pretty drama-free. the
thing i appreciate most is a good conversation: some current events
mixed with pop culture references sprinkled with some off-colour
humor and the odd moment of revelation... something like that.",100000
"i'm pretty much a regular guy. i enjoy conversation with smart
engaged people and making people laugh.",100000
"i'm pretty much your online dating horror story so if you like
horror stories read on. i'm short* fat bald and a pervert. i'm
seeing someone right now and don't really have time to date anyone
else seriously but i will go out to eat with anyone interesting
and/or fuck them and my so is ok with that. that being said i'm
mentally stable have a decent job and my own place and i know the
difference between ""there"" ""they're"" and ""their."" i'll only be in
one serious relationship at a time but i do like to fuck around
in a responsible and open way with communication and respect yadda

kinds of funny and the ironic) am pretty laid back sensitive

an excellent listener). my friends trust me and respect my
honesty.my friends know i am a total dog person (cats are ok but
i'm allergic).<br />
i love good food (i can and will eat or try just about anything)
music (i'm a musician with esoteric tastes) smells (i smell
everything - bay laurel and eucalyptus<br />

seeing or experiencing a new place or a new thing.i love sun surf
mountains but i also love san francisco<br />
and some of the urban aspects of the bay area (and other urban
areas i've visited throughout the country and the world). i adore
the simple beaties of nature and can be entirely<br />
stunned watching a raptor in flight but can also get a thrill
looking straight up the south tower of the golden gate bridge (i'm
a mechanical engineer by training so the bridge just kills
me).<br />
i work hard so i do value downtime hanging out and looking for
something interesting on netflixor listening to tunes either my
favorites or exploring new stuff.<br />

satisfying which is good 'cuz i'm there a good chunk of the
week.<br />

i've been involved music in some way as long as i can remember. if
i'm staring at the wall i'm probably working on a new melody.

"i'm san francisco-born and bay area-raised. i've been back in the

i'm looking to meet some new people. i love being back here being
close to my family and being in what i think is one of the
greatest areas in the country. there's so much to do and see and i

"i'm someone who doesn't take things for granted and i have a huge
love for life. i'm energetic simple and sympathetic and a little
sarcastic. i'm down to earth and carry light baggage zero debt and
no regrets.<br />
<br />
i was born in germany studied and lived in three countries
(australia uk germany) and traveled the world a bit and now i am
here working at uc berkeley as a scientist loving every minute of
it. as i'm new in the area i'd love to meet someone to explore the
bay area. i could tell you how funny i am and that i'm an ambitious
person yet very sensitive and caring but i think a person is best
described by the things she/he does and likes so here it
goes:<br />
<br />
one of the most important things in my life are my family and
friends. i love paragliding probably because it's the closest
thing i've found to living the childhood fantasy of flight. (ok
it's still my fantasy even if i am technically an adult now).<br />
<br />
further hobbies include backpacking <a href=""http://beel.org/travel_reports.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">photography</a> sport (ultimate frisbee skiing
swimming) and dancing (tango rock `n` roll). i just started to
learn the guitar and like going to concerts. i like pretty much
every kind of music and thanks to my european origin trance :). a
couple of years ago i took some horse riding lessons and did some
short horse riding trips in chile argentina and mexico. i would
like to start horse riding again so if you have some ideas where
to do it in the bay area... please tell me.<br />
<br />
i have a positive attitude to life and with my inquisitive mind
i'm very open to new adventures like this one. :p i'm looking for
someone who has good values is a good communicator genuine
intelligent easy going and optimistic.<br />
<br />
my profile here is a bit brief. if you want to find out more visit
my website with plenty of pictures from my travels. just follow
this <a href=""http://beel.org"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">link</a>.",100000
"i'm someone who is a great fan of diversity. i don't necessarily
have a type but i do like a woman who is feminine soft sweet
and caring. i am a fan of girls with style makeup who tend
towards the submissive and soft but have a backbone and are not
pushovers. i'm not one to shy away from a conversation and am
willing to spend the time working through differences to build a
better connection.<br />
<br />
ideally you will be well-maintained have a flair for style and
make the effort to take care of your body and your mind. i am not a
smoker and consider myself a light drinker (wine beer occasional
cocktails) so i'd love to meet someone who likes cafes just as
much as bars (if not more). i love diverse music with dance music
being my favorite. i make cds for all my friends.<br />
<br />
i'm an unusual american who has traveled extensively and speaks 6
languages very well. i studied in england france and germany and
spent time working in latin america. i'd love to meet someone who
knows the world a bit or is interested to learn.<br />
<br />
i'm also a looking for someone who is really into physical fitness.
i'm athletic and often at the gym playing basketball lifting
weights doing cardio etc. i am an excellent baseball player and
love football too. also enjoy frisbee swimming and tennis.<br />
<br />
someone with their finances in order would be preferred but is not
mandatory. i'm super responsible and have built financial
independence over the years. i am an investor and a homeowner who
lives in a beautiful home that i've built to my tastes.<br />
<br />
i would be remiss not to mention i'm an extremely physical person.
sex is one of the most important things to me so i'm looking for
an adventurous physical person who appreciate my dominance in bed
but may be self-assertive outside of the bedroom. i also wouldn't
mind someone who is either physically experienced or very willing
to learn. if you're not deeply interested in sex and your body we
are probably not a fit.<br />
<br />
please feel free to wink or send a line. if i like you i will
definitely contact you back!",100000
"i'm still new-ish to this site so this summary is a work in
progress. i'll start with what you won't find here; no pictures of
me scaling mount everest and giving the thumbs-up near the summit
walking over hot coals in borneo cliff diving in acapulco or
leaping in sf with some awe-inspiring wall art in the background as
some really cute baby looks on. if you need photos of things like
this to convince you i'm a fun guy then i'm not the right guy for
you....just saying :)<br />
<br />
i'm a very funny and passionate guy who tries his hardest to help
everyone i can while accomplishing everything my ambition and the
laws of physics will allow. to the best of my ability my life is
guided by principles but i promise you i'm not ben stein or a
reanimated corpse in disguise! (ie i'm not boring) i really get the
utmost enjoyment out of making other people laugh smile and feel
good about themselves. i will not bullshit you with braggadocio or
legerdemain but at the same time i try not to take life too
seriously....it's all about balance.<br />
<br />
on the less serious side i love new experiences (and well-known
but fun ones too) telling corny jokes and talking tasteful smack
with my friends and co-workers but i also relish a relaxed and
thought-provoking conversation with someone comfortable in her own
skin. more than that i love listening and a conversation with me
will be judgment-free. i am humble but not a doormat; for zest
life requires some good old-fashioned chutzpah or else it's like
spaghetti without the sauce (still fortifying but no zing).
speaking of spaghetti if you and i were ever out at dinner you
would be surprised at how much food i can eat and still stay
athletic. you might even be pissed off at me for how much food i
can eat yet not turn into a blimp!<br />
<br />
also i take horrific photos. i am actually much better looking in
real life than my anti-photogenic mug shots suggest (according to
the opinions of others). so don't get too scared at my
franken-photos :) for a point of reference if you could imagine
apollo ohno or pete sampras having a cousin that sort of looked
like them that would be me :)<br />
<br />
one more thing; sure i'm preferably looking to date (or more
serious if it turns out this way) but i'm still new-ish to the area
and would be happy just to have the opportunity to meet cool people
(cool as defined by me = not incredibly difficult to get along
with). i literally know no one here outside of work (besides casual
conversation at the gym and library) and would really like to
change that.....just being honest!!!!",100000
"i'm still trying to find the elusive ""one"" with great conversations
and sense of adventure.<br />
<br />
i like being involved in various social activities so you'll
rarely find me spending all day at home in front of tv (although my
tivo does get some use on weeknights). while i'm not a hard-core
biker i enjoy an occasional bike ride and would like to explore
some of the bike trails in marin. i've gotten hooked on trying new
places and recently have been chasing various food carts like the
creme brulee cart and pizza hacker. while i've lived in bay area
for many years i only recently moved up to sf and have this urge
to catch up on all these ""only in sf' things that i've been missing
out on.<br />

my friends consider me a pretty happy person with lots of energy
who is rarely sad or bogged down with things. i try to plan my life

friends.<br />

required; i'm actually interested in making new friends too)<br />

to grab some drinks watch the game or maybe even hit the race
track for some fun with my cars. but on saturday i will be having
a romantic night out on the town or cuddled up on the couch with my
lady. i work hard play hard and give 110% in everything
especially my relationships. i love to travel and experience new
things whenever possible. i am still on the fence about online
dating as i think you will never fall for someone by reading a
description on a screen. but i'd love to meet new friends and see
what happens from there!",100000
"i'm the kind of person who chooses friends very carefully but is
undyingly loyal to them. perhaps to the point of a fault.<br />

term.",100000
"i'm the nice guy that finishes first. i work really hard and play

japanese girl. wit is nice. i seek inspiration through people
places objects and experiences.<br />

i'm planing my next trip for the big 30. i want to do
europe...again. maybe japan. thoughts?<br />

i like whisky and old fashions. snowboarding is my bliss this year

more than ever i feel like i'm self-actualized and living the
dream.<br />

i'm strongly driven to create new things or synthesize existing
ideas into something unique and useful. i enjoy being the pioneer
of new concepts and ideas.<br />

internet and the transformative effect the two are having on our
world.",100000
"i'm the worst person to write a profile. i'm a hack writer who
can't write in my own voice. i don't talk like this i don't act
like this but i do write like this. you're stuck with me your
unreliable narrator; i'll try to be honest but nobody's who they
say they are... and writers are the worst.<br />
<br />
writing's not my job just a hobby. a computer game company writes
me checks to program for them. the checks seem to shrink the more i
enjoy my job but i'll trade contentment for cash anyday.<br />
<br />
either because of my situation or my disposition i'm laid back
about big things with short bursts of intensity about little
things. i can spend hours baking and decorating an elaborate
birthday cake but spend less time than that thinking about my
career. i drive driven people crazy.<br />
<br />
which isn't to say i'm a flake or a slacker. towards my
relationships responsibilities and my hobbies i'm very committed
but not very openly passionate. i've played ultimate frisbee for
almost half my life have been programming just as long and i get
up at 7:30 every morning to practice ""ghetto workouts."" but you
won't find any tattooes or bumper stickers pronouncing my love for
any of these. for me a certain level of everyday low level
stick-to-it-ness and consideration says a lot more than
flowers.<br />
<br />
when i'm with someone it's all about finding new things in
everyday situations whether it be a different restaurant a new tv
show or a weird play exploring our own neighborhood or just
creative conversation. talking is the constant in my life: i love
talking as an expression of ideas. silly ideas funny ideas well
expressed ideas well thought out ideas weird ideas -- anything
that makes the normal world seem a little fresher.<br />
<br />
i think accepting random ideas makes me more optimistic. the glass
is always three quarters full to me. as a both sides of the street
are sunny optimist i can see the good and fun side of everything...
except complainers. i hate complainers.<br />

so that's sort of me. take it with a grain of salt. i'm a lot more
normal in person... so don't be disappointed.",100000

i grew up around the older folk in a very large italian family. one
side of the family blue collar the other very white collar. best of
both worlds and best of both hells. but i love them all. my humor
was affected so i'm old school (think steve allen and woody allen
mixed with jerry lewis). humor has many moods. i'm very logically
oriented but not a freak about it. my career is in computer
software and/or managing computer projects (large ones). so i speak
geek and boardroom fluently but prefer geek. geeks have better
gadgets.<br />

thousands) of peoples' faces read all about what they have to say

people are willing to market themselves as being. it's funny that i
feel like i learn more about people by sitting on my computer for
hours on end than out being a person in the real world. is that how
it should be? i really don't know but i guess i'm on this site

the majority of my attention focused on entrepreneurial pursuits
sometimes to my own personal detriment.<br />

i'm crafty and sarcastic. clearly you are reading the profile of
the most handsome man on all of okcupid yet it turns out that i'm
extremely humble. i maintain this elite appearance by working out
daily. i live near haight / ashbury and since there are no gyms
within a reasonable walking proximity i have taken it upon myself
to begin construction of a prison-style gym on the private patio of
my san francisco condo.<br />

religion isn't important to me. my parents backgrounds are irish
protestant and russian jew but i am not religious. i repeat: i am
not religious and do not identify with either of these
designations. i do however fill that gap with an interest in
science brain function and the universe all of which are
fascinating and i would love to have you join me in the viewing of
programs like ""i survived beyond &amp; back"" ""jill bolte taylor's
stroke of insight"" or ""stephen hacking's did god create the
universe?"".<br />

enjoyed and that has allowed me to grow. this is all still the

why am i here? well in a perfect world it would be cool to find
someone who makes me excited to wake up every day (even more so
than i already am); someone who makes me want to better myself so
that i can make them as happy as possible. i would hope that
whoever i end up with shares this sentiment.<br />
<br />
that's my long term strategy anyway. in the meantime i just want
to get to know as many cool people as possible. and i really mean
that. if you aren't looking for a romantic thing but you're cool
and you suspect that i'm cool too (good guess ;-) drop me a line

i have lots of people around me whose company i enjoy and with whom
i partake in all kinds of activities. at the end of the day
though there is a really select group of people with whom i
connect on a deep fundamental level. i could sit and talk to any
of them for well as much time as is available. i call them my
dinner party guests because i imagine getting them all together
for a small yet epic dinner party at some point in the
indeterminate future. i'm not sure what kind of food would be
served yet but it would have to be easy to chew and swallow
because with the amount of wit in the room it's likely that people
wouldn't be able to stop laughing long enough to masticate

"let's have a bit of conversation. get to know each other. become
friends  and maybe then lovers.<br />
we can begin with tales of songs and dances movies and plays work
and workouts children and pets and family and friends but we'll
also learn each other's thoughts about open-heartedness
mindfulness integrity and the importance of knowing and trusting
ourselves well enough to be honest about who we are and what we're
looking for. maybe then we'll become lovers. or maybe not. if we
become lovers it will be transformational filled with music and
laughter and an expression of the truth of the equation 1 plus 1
equals 3.<br />
a bit about me and what i'm doing <br />
i've worked and played hard all my life and have been fortunate on
many levels. my work life has been spent investigating and
prosecuting economic fraudsters. i'm not a lawyer but i work as a
judge. i work four days per week and i play the other three. i'm
financially and emotionally secure.<br />
i'm broadening and deepening my circle of friends staying
connected with my daughter raising my 14 year old son in
collaboration with his mother exercising refreshing my cooking
skills eating well entertaining at home reading writing
exploring back roads around the world from the seat of an iron
horse riding real horses whenever i can get my hands on a good
one working on my golf game and kayaking i rarely watch sports on
tv and strongly prefer evenings that don't include much tv. i
listen to blues jazz reggae rock bluegrass new grass real
country classical and more. i love to dance. i like to catch a
good movie at home in front of the fireplace or at a non-mainstream
theatre or go out on the town with friends. i'm currently making
plans to ride my scoot to the san juan islands and back. next i'll
explore costa rica australia and later the mediterranean 
specifically spain greece italy and france.<br />
a bit about you <br />
feel free to reach out to me if you're smart physically fit
open-hearted honest self-aware love to travel via all manner of
modes of transportation (including by motorcycle) and understand
the art of living a love where 1 plus 1 equals 3.",100000
"let's see...i'm pretty well-read sarcastic and analytical. i'm
open honest forward and direct. i know a lot of adjectives. i
don't have a foot fetish or any other strange proclivities. it's a
shame i don't live in canada because i'm 2 meters tall and weigh
100 kilograms. (that's 6'6"" 220 for the conversion challenged.)
i've driven to 47 of the lower 48 states. (screw delaware.) i
tolerate all the stupid tall jokes people make. (you seriously have
no idea how hard this is.) i've mastered parentheses. pretty much
anything interests me so i rarely get bored. i'm opinionated but
if you reason with me i might actually change my mind.<br />
<br />
more about myself: i value good conversation over just about
anything else. my absolute favorite thing to do is to just hang out
and joke around with a group of friends. i read a lot; my favorite
book is the great santini by pat conroy. it's funny exciting and
profound kinda like the american beauty of books.<br />
<br />
what else...i'm a big journal writer it's very good for ordering
my thoughts and just remembering how things were for when i want to
get all teary-eyed and sentimental later in life. humorwise the
simpsons south park daily show the office triumph the insult
comic dog seinfeld and the onion are all hilarious. i'm a former
basketball player and i still either play basketball or work out
pretty much every day. i am a google reader and plus addict. i love
to drive and take long road trips. i'm very close with my family
and friends. as for religion let's just say my philosophy is that
if god paid attention to us he'd have smote me by now. oh yeah if
you didn't like what i wrote fantastic! it was designed to weed
you out.<br />
<br />
as for you...you make me laugh and you're a great
conversationalist. someone could legitimately describe you as
charismatic. you lead a somewhat active life and you're passionate
about something i don't care what. intelligence is always a plus.
you have an ego. you'll do some of the planning. finally you'll
fire back at me when i make fun of you or even better make fun of
me first. oh yeah it would probably be best if you weren't easily
offended. that's it.<br />
<br />
p.s.--i've taken up skiing the past 3 seasons and i'm now obsessed
with going to tahoe as often as possible. if you are good enough
(at either skiing or snowboarding) to push me to get better that

like to be someday.<br />
but before i tell you more you must know that i have a 5 year old
son who is the light of my life. i share custody which allows me to
have my adult time but i always put him first and want someone who
will be understanding as to how much time children need. with that
said if you are still interested i will tell you more...<br />

i am not a serial dater and would honestly like to find someone
that will be a friend soul-mate and partner in crime. i want a
man who is athletic enjoys laughing and making me laugh can play
like he did when he was 16 and if he can cook.... well that is
icing on the cake. i want a man who is secure with who he is and
enjoys a to have a conversation about the day... for whatever that
may be.<br />

i love to hear from a man a simple ""hi... how is your day?""... busy
lives and busy days... but knowing when to just say ""hi"" is
unbelievably romantic....<br />

friends and running. running has been an outlet that has taken me

places to explore flavors to taste and people to meet. i like to

good friends and familiar neighborhoods but there is always
another hidden treasure to discover right under your nose.<br />

i've only been here for just over a year but i'm already beginning
to fall in love with the city - both its character and its
inhabitants. i'm looking to meet more people who share my
interests or who can introduce me to something new.<br />

i would describe myself as kind positive honest smart and
adventurous. (i'm also very flirtatious).<br />

engineers who build cool stuff. (ok so i have a friend who calls
us bro-grammers but i think she just has a little nerd envy - and
i'm totally not a bro bro!).<br />

my interests include sailing cooking and riding my bike. on most
weekends you'll find me at the marina working on the boat or out on
the bay sailing. there's nothing like being out on the water.<br />

my own mistakes as well as my successes. learning new things never

the hard way- but we're all a work in process right? i am
recovering work-aholic. i have learned there is more to life than
what you do. now i'm working to find solid balance in most corners
of my life. i understand the importance of a career &amp; a
comfortable living; the trick is to find the sweet spot in the
middle. i am a firm believer that pets are part of the family. i
come with a whole cast of characters including a dog and cat. two
firm disclaimers; the dog will take a long time to win over and the
allergic/ocd need not respond as the pets and (their hair) are a
packaged deal. but if you can put up with them it means you are
probably pretty special.<br />
other things i believe: laughter is the best medicine. you can
teach an old dog new tricks. if you volunteer you will learn
about yourself and others. yosemite is amazing &amp; redwood trees
are a treasure. saying thank you is important. everyone should know
how to change a tire. dinner a glass of wine and great
conversation is underrated. i should go to the gym way more than i
do. i want kids but not unless it's with the right person. i feel
like a better person when i do yoga. communication is the key. i
believe in one complementing the other; figuratively &amp;
literally. i believe in teamwork working together laughing
together &amp; growing together.<br />
i am trying to meet someone closer to being on the page that i am
on. ultimately i am looking to date someone who is fun to be
around. i love funny guys who can tell great story &amp; make me

time with is comfortable with himself with his own healthy balance
is best friend material someone you want to spend the long term
with. someone i can be honest and open with laugh with talk to

advantage of it whenever i can. the plan is to play more than work

best recipes cookbook from atk. i like to try fun and easy recipes
from online food blogs and use my friends as guinea pigs. i don't
think they mind too much. i've especially baked a bunch of birthday
cakes. it's the best way to celebrate and spread the goods
around!<br />
<br />
i am mellow gracious and genuine",100000
"my life is implausible enough that the narrative of my life would
be considered bad fiction because no one would write something
with such cliches. i am not sure if i am the good guy or the
villain or maybe just a good old anti-hero.<br />
<br />
i'm unusually ambitious goal-directed competent and lazy. people
always assume that i must secretly be working harder than i am
until they realize that not working so hard is actually really
hard.<br />
<br />
this means i have a lot of free time and the money to mostly do
whatever i want. sometimes that's international travel or skiing
for the midweek session other times painfully hip music events
other times it's waking up at 3pm and only leaving my house to walk
to the grocery store and cooking dinner for myself.",100000
"my life is sort of like a cross between an escher and a dali
painting. every morning i wake up and laugh a little about the
life i find myself living. i'm constantly surrounded by
high-functioning slightly off lunatics who are a constant source
of education and entertainment. i like doing fun things for the
hell of it. i ski climb kayak bike and watch lots of movies.",100000
"my motto in life: it's not about where you are or what you're
doing but who you're sharing the experiences with.<br />
<br />
so it comes naturally that my favorite thing to do is to hang out
with my friends whether it be going to bars/clubbing snowboarding
golfing riding motorcycles or just playing board games! i'm
always down to do anything as long as it's with the right
people.<br />
<br />
i like to think that i'm a chill laid-back guy that takes things
in stride. i was born in japan and i'm actually still a japanese
citizen even though i moved to the bay area when i was one year
old. the perks of being a japanese citizen include no jury duty and
the ability to visit cuba! though i've never had the opportunity
to take advantage of that fact... it doesn't really outweigh the
fact that i'm unable to vote does it? :p<br />
<br />
my biggest fault is my forgetfulness. it makes me ask people's name
multiple times before i get to know them well and i'm really
terrible at directions! i always carry my phone or gps. worst case
i get to take a road trip around my destination but that's fun in
and of itself sometimes. :p<br />
<br />
on the other hand i think my biggest assets are my positive
outlooks general open-mindedness occasional quick wits and the
appreciation and respect that i have for my friends and
people.<br />
<br />
i like emoticons. :d",100000
"my name is ben. i'm a decent looking broad shoulder tall type. i
have a professional job and a down-to-earth attitude.<br />
<br />
my ideal mate is a pretty woman who wears high heels when
appropriate but also loves being in nature and loves being
natural. i like to entertain friends and family hang out with
other couples and i like to cook.<br />
<br />
i read a lot and write. my one big aspiration is to publish a
novel. otherwise i do what i wanted to do for a living. live where
i wanted to live. i've always wanted to visit europe so i'm going
to spend june traveling around the mediterranean. barcelona to
istanbul in 30 days. i tend to do whatever i set out to do.<br />
<br />
aside from my darling niece who is living on my sofa currently
i'm alon. while i prefer to be with someone i'm kinda picky and
willing to wait for someone i really get along with. i'd say i like
beautiful women but most really beautiful women don't think of
themselves that way so i'll just say i'm waiting for someone who
is beautiful to me.<br />

the most important thing in a relationship for me is enjoying the
company of the other person.",100000

recently promoted to head burger flipper. i live in my mom's

i'm greg. i'm stable easy-going intelligent open-minded
confident social active optimistic ambitious and generous. i
am a consultant by trade a graduate student a 3rd generation
marine and a part-time dad to an awesome 3 yo boy who lives with
his mom nearby.<br />
<br />
i'm in no hurry for a relationship but definitely down to meet
cool women. imho anyone who feels incomplete without a
relationship should reconsider his or her priorities. my 20's are
way behind me; today i choose honesty and enjoyment over bullshit
and drama. chemistry is critical physical emotional and
mental.<br />
<br />
if we hang out we may spend a day sailing check out a boat show
go on a group scooter/motorcycle ride catch dinner and a comedy
show hit a music festival head up to the mountains for some
snowboarding take a salsa or swing class try our hand at making a
fancy italian dish or hit the foothills for a hike.<br />
<br />
i love travel but really who doesn't? i mean if you don't love
it you either haven't tried it or live in complete fear. i make
it a point to travel often. i'd rather not eat out for a month and
spend 5 days in guatemala. travel doesn't have to be expensive.
i've been to six continents and don't intend to stop.<br />

i am a responsible mature adult. i am on occasion a neat freak. i
am not however some kind of staid uptight individual. i rather
enjoy being silly too much to take myself that seriously. it is
much more fun to get things done while being ridiculous.<br />

this is probably corny sounding but i genuinely enjoy making other
people happy. this is not to the exclusion of taking some time and
energy for myself so i would not say i am some kind of
doormat.<br />

i spend a lot of time being sarcastic and enjoy using the
occasional bit of self-deprecating humor. i really like telling
jokes and funny stories so i would like to imagine that i have a
good sense of humor.<br />

i will rock that zipline. no need to ask twice.<br />
<br />
i enjoy cooking playing games with friends clubbing and dancing
sports cars visiting museums going to the opera and reading. i
have a deep appreciation for life-long learning so i am always
trying to develop knowledge and skills in many areas. i can build
camp fires under adverse conditions (unlike the engineer from
mit... pfft engineers am i right?). i have won an award for my
drink mixing skills (which includes the application of liquid
nitrogen).<br />

really love it here.",100000

taken me. i've always taken advantage of opportunities that come my
way - whether for a new job opportunity across the country or
seeing a midnight movie. i can feel at home just about anywhere as
long as i can find a place to run a job i find rewarding a
downtown with a fun vibe and a few good friends. it's a priority of
mine to expand the list of places in the world i've visited.<br />
<br />
i love meeting and connecting with new people. my group of friends
is eclectic and i have a real appreciation for people who are
interested in making their mark on the world. i'm also a totally
proud and indulgent aunt and the owner of a spoiled but very sweet
dog. i take life and myself seriously but with a hefty does of
spontaneity and silliness. i can laugh at myself at others (in an
amiable way) or sometimes for almost no reason at all.<br />
<br />
i'm comfortable in lots of different places and with lots of
different types of people. i enjoy both long deep conversations
and witty banter but the type of conversation is entirely
dependent on the situation and often the amount of wine!<br />
<br />
i've got ordering food down to a science but i'm also a fairly
good cook in my own kitchen. i like experimenting with recipes
which inevitably lead to a few stressful moments of panic when i'm
sure it's not going to work out but fortunately it tends to come
together!<br />

purpose.<br />
i enjoy weekend trips whether its north to wine country or down to
la.<br />
i do cook. a few months ago i started perfecting pizza crust. but
most dishes i create are fusion. my favorite dish consist of fried
rice coconut milk tofu roasted cashew broccoli mushrooms and
indian masala seasoning. i'm sure it sounds crazy but it's
good.<br />
i like to go out dancing warehouse parties and salsa. i would
really like to have more lessons so if your are interested let me

i enjoy the outdoors. my favorite place to go is the bristlecone
pine forest in the white mountains. it is a very quiet place...
just me and some very old trees. in the winter i ski. i spend as
much time in the mountains as i can. so i am always taking trips up
there with friends.<br />

happy 2012! i'm from new zealand; lived there until feb 2010 when

fewer vowels than before and getting the hang of ounces pounds

january</a>.<br />
<br />
i'm easy going enough to date a lot of girls but falling in love
is complicated. i got out of a relationship in september and so
far haven't actively been looking for another one - but i'm ready
for the right girl to change my mind. does the following sound
familiar?<br />
<br />
you're smart. really smart. top of the class and proud of it. you
love to learn and are curious about everything. you could talk all
day about your favourite subject. you tend to intimidate ""cool""
guys but are frustrated by socially awkward nerds (although you're
on the nerdy side yourself). you're confident and have a goal in
life. you love to travel - you've been overseas before and dream
about your next adventure. you think you're pretty kick-ass but
you're not spoilt. you don't believe it's anybody else's job to
take care of you but you appreciate having doors opened for you
and would find it romantic if i cooked you dinner gave you a back
massage or brought you fresh-baked waffles in bed.<br />
<br />
you take care of yourself. you're in the healthy weight range (slim
to average figure). you have a smile that lights up the room and
you love to dance. you have great taste in music and can introduce
me to bands i've never heard of before.<br />
<br />
you're affectionate. you like to at least try to sleep snuggled
together even if it ends up with the comforter on the floor and
neither of us able to feel our arms. i keep my apartment warm;
it'll be all right :)<br />
<br />
you're full of energy never afraid of hard work or the outdoors
(bonus points if you ski snowboard cycle hike or rock climb)
but just as happy to spend a morning (or a day) lazing around at
home. you love animals and want to get a dog someday.<br />
<br />
<s>if i just described you skip the rest and message me now - or
rate me 5 stars and i'll take a look at your profile and write to
you if i think we might click.</s><br />

outside of the whole dating thing i'm also looking to make friends
with experienced skiers and snowboarders. if you can make your way
down black diamond runs please drop me a line!<br />

i'm new to the city and work a lot. when i'm not working i like to

out with friends watch movies read (i'm actually an avid reader)
and listen to music. i love trying out new restaurants and
bars.<br />

i guess some seemingly obvious things need to be said: if we hang
out please don't plan our future wedding the first time we meet
up; let's take things a bit slower than that. also i'm not just a
piece of meat. you can call me old fashioned if you'd like but
you're going to have to wine and dine me first.<br />

i have a weakness for smart girls. the smarter the better. if
you're ambitious and have a sense-of-humor that's a definite plus.
i'm a big fan of engaging conversations so i'm looking for someone
smart who can challenge me.<br />
<br />
i've recently started to get into wine. i try to be open-minded
about things but for too long i wrote off wine as a delicacy of
the pretentious. i've been giving it a go lately (although not too
much everything in moderation) and have surprisingly enjoyed it.

find someone who can turn me on to some new good wines.",100000

i'm down-to-earth friendly creative and not afraid to swim
against the current. i enjoy my work in a career that sits at the
intersection of the life sciences healthcare and web development.
i practiced law for 15 years or so then secured an mba and worked
in high tech for several years. in the spring of 2000 my
girlfriend was diagnosed with lung cancer and i became her
caregiver and an activist in the lung cancer support community.

took care of her.<br />

toby at dog parks in marin pt. isabel ft. funsten and others. yet
aside from that (and including that as well if you like dogs) i
have an abundance of free time that would ideally be spent against
a backdrop of romance and shared experience.<br />

i very much enjoy my long evening walks serenaded by audiobooks
and podcasts peering into the fishbowl of how everyone else is
living. but i do long for the days when the weekends consisted of a
whole lot more and were shared.<br />

artist is bela fleck and the flecktones.<br />

meet a partner who is intelligent attracitve confident etc.

oh yeah i recycle and i'm a real nice person. :-)<br />
<br />
i am honest direct and sincere",100000
"now this is great. somewhere is is written that one should try to
limit the use of the pronoun 'i' when one is writing. then someone
comes along with something like this self-summary where the 'i' is
glorified. ok well i'm great! how is that for ego?<br />
if i were to outline myself one word at a time here is a short
list. happy aggressive smart kind generous brave inventive.
leaving happy at the head the other adjectives can be put in any
orderdepending on the time of day.",100000
"oh hello! i'm christian. that's my name not religion. people have
gotten confused about that before.<br />
<br />
look we're all busy here. reading profiles is *really* hard work.
so i'll keep from writing an autobiography here just focus on a
few points. we'll learn more about each other when you message
me!<br />
<br />
i'm a tech guy working at a large silicon valley company in a
senior role and building a startup on the side. i guess you could
say i'm pretty successful in my career at this point too.<br />
<br />
i'm an amateur photographer. i like to take photos of very small
things. my lens may be huge but i'm not compensating. they just
make them that big!<br />
<br />
i worked as a royal wedding photographer one night in vegas. long
story.<br />
<br />
i'm not a body builder or weight lifter or model or ginormously
tall. instead i'm other very good things. by the way that's
partly why you don't see photos of me with my shirt off (i'm told
this is a good thing).<br />
<br />
i'm not a player and i'm not into ""the game."" i'd like to find a
real person someone interesting and loving and beautiful (however
that manifests in you). or someone with really interesting stories
to tell.",100000
"ok first thing all my pics are me and my dog my dog recently
passed away and i haven't been out trying to get new photos. so if
any of you out there are up to take some pics message me. ok with
that out of the way about me. i am a pretty simple guy nothing
extravagent or unique here. i enjoy most sports i like to play
hockey and golf and poker. i don't know if poker or even golf is a
sport but they are both on espn so i will go with it. i love
movies. i miss going to dog parks. i work horrible hours at least
horrible if i want any kind of a social life. but i love my job and
i find that work wise i like those hours a lot more. i really don't
know what else to say on here go ahead and message me with ideas.",100000
"ok i am finally editing my self summary with something meaningful.
why the hell do i have a profile on here? initially i think it was
mostly to feed my ego not really much else. until recently that is.
i guess you could say i have been going through somewhat of a
midlife transformation. it all started a couple of years ago
really. i did not act out by buying an expensive car or some other
trophy the general population would recognize. instead i decided to
move to a new city and gain some new perspective. i brought along
with me however an attitude towards relationships that was
defeatist at best. after a 20 year string of failed relationships i
had come to the conclusion that i was really better off all on my
own and i truly felt that i was not capable of falling in love
again at this point in my life.<br />
<br />
after a couple of happy years in san francisco i find myself in a
much altered state. i felt a major shift in my attitude toward
relationships a month or so ago. i was having a conversation about
all of this with a new friend i had met while traveling and they
suggested to me that my heart chakra had opened up again. i am not
an especially spiritual person and i don't subscribe to any sort of
organized religion or philosophies but i do think the spirit of
that statement is true. i do now crave falling in love and equally
as important i welcome the love of another into my life.<br />
<br />
so aside from looking for someone super awesome to spend time with
i am a musician that is desperate to play out since moving to sf. i
love to travel. i would definitely be classified as a geek. i am an
engineer as a profession. i have a kick ass cat. i love seeing live
music/bands. i am always up for a flick. if you think you are weird
i will probably like you. i am willing to try just about anything
and i am always up for some adventure!<br />
<br />
i am wire wood and watts",100000
"ok let me preface this by saying i am good at a lot of things
writing a dating site profile is not among them.",100000
"ok this is evidently my chance to impress you in some way. but i'm
experienced enough to know that as much as i think i understand
what women want they are still a deep mystery to me. i mean guys
are frankly one dimensional creatures and we are often able to put
up a good front but my guess is that most of these profiles are
pretty transparent efforts to express manly confidence despite our
more or less unconscious confusion about the fundamental rules of
the game. the rules are largely created by women (at least in the
world of straight post-modern american culture) and are
understandably self-serving. but the large number of otherwise
smart women who end up with douchey guys with frat-boy
sensibilities tells me that women can be just as confused by it
all.<br />
<br />
what i'm looking for is a woman who is willing to explore the
strange beautiful ambiguity of the reality of life. oh and you
need to be willing to learn how to salsa dance. that's about it. :)",100000
"ok. let's see. i was born in the ukraine and my family moved to
wisconsin when i was 12. after that i lived and went to school in
wisconsin/illinois until a few years ago when i moved to ca. i
like ca the best (in large part due to the amazing weather here).
here i work as a software engineer.<br />
<br />
i enjoy spending time with friends watching tv playing games
eating good food playing sports etc. i really love to travel as
well. my sister lives in paris hoping to go visit her this spring!",100000
"ok... i am not very good at explaining myself but i will try.
overall i am very intelligent affectionate caring funny and a
trustworthy person. if you need me i will be there for you.<br />
<br />
actually a flaw i will openly say i have is that i am needy not
financially or anything because i do very well but i want to be
held and feel loved and i wanna hold you and love you. i don't want
to tell you about an awesome trip or a fun night that i had i
rather you to experience it with me. i want to go on vacation with
you shows plays new york vegas horse back riding snow
boarding or whatever you want to do. i want you to be as much of a
part of my life as i am yours. i don't want to make a decision
without considering how you would feel.<br />
<br />
well i like to lift weights and workout. it makes me feel good and
keeps me healthy. i also enjoy bike riding rock climbing and
traveling. i just recently acquired a time share and am anxiously
waiting to use it.<br />
<br />
my goals are probably the same as yours i just want to be
successful in my career and fruitful with my time. my title is
north american clinical specialist director. which basically means
i just travel around the us and abroad setting up clinical trials
for hospitals (fun stuff (not)). i want 2.5 kids and a house with a
white picket fence just like you. at this point in time i value my
happiness above all else.<br />
<br />
what makes me unique i talk to people constantly and have been
trained to read body language facial expressions so when i ask you
a question i have a pretty good idea if you are telling the truth
or not. i am a real good judge of character and can often read
people. i am not saying i am always right but more often then not i
am pretty on the money.<br />
<br />
i am confident lovely and lonely",100000
"okay so i am rather new and not entirely enthused about this whole
online dating thing (so far)... it almost seems easier to hit on
gals in the supermarket but i have heard a lot of people have meet
on this site and similar ones so what the hell eh.<br />
<br />
music seems to be a common thread that can shed light into ones
personality so i'll touch upon the surface of that... well i
don't really listen to much music (music of my own choosing anyway)
but when i do it generally is something that moves and inspires
me. music that generally builds tempo and/or unfolds with harmony
is what i find captivating. that ranges from classical through all
various (but not all) forms of jazz to trance techno and house.
last but not least would be good ole classic rock... too many
bands to really mention and narrowing myself to a handful of bands
(even 50) would be disingenuous and pretentious.<br />
<br />
i am somebody who feels strongly about drawing ones conclusions
themselves. my tendency is to protect my family and close friends
so i naturally question authority and view my societies (and my
own) liberties as paramount. i prefer to have options rather than
obligations but i have no fear of committing to what is true and
obvious. like a good song or movie i hope to build momentum and
tempo to a crescendo. i believe timing is fundamental and perhaps
within an area like the bay area people can get lost in the
shuffle. kindness and politeness are lost in some cases in favor of
a on-demand culture. a culture of instant access and availability
with words meaning less and less as they become more and more
instant. i work in it (network/internet security) but i view it as
a job rather than a lifestyle. i love history and what thousands of
years have taught us and not just what a few decades or a couple of
centuries have.<br />
<br />
i have been told i am a very passionate man both at work and
outside of work. if i like something i go after it with passion and
vigor otherwise i don't bother pursuing it.<br />
<br />
look there is no way i can entirely describe myself here and
beyond what i have said i am not even going to attempt to. what i
am really looking for is someone who is similar in that way and
prefers to break the ice the old fashion way (in person or perhaps
over the phone).",100000
"okay i'm only kidding about the spam business. seriously though: i
work as a psychotherapist for the dept. of public health. service
and giving of myself are very important to me. i'm at a point in my
life where i'm past dating past working on my career and wanting
to find a life long relationship.<br />

i grew up on the peninsula attended catholic schools through high
school...i know i know! attended sfsu for my bs and ms. i've been
a music major taught piano performance and music to children
worked on a crisis hotline and bus tables in lake tahoe during my
formative years.<br />
<br />
my first kiss was when i was 14 on the beach at lake tahoe in the
summer. my heart was broken for the first time when i was 21. i've
been fortunate to have traveled to 11 countries and want to travel
more. i've never broken a single bone in my body. i've been in only
one fist fight in my life. my eyes well up during sappy movies. i
have low blood pressure. everyone thinks i'm 10 years younger than
i am....i thank my parents insane genetics.....but i also think its
because i hit puberty quite late...like 17 :( i don't have children
but hope to be a husband partner and friend and father one day.",100000
"okay selling time...oh oh... pick me! pick me!!! :)<br />
<br />
i'm honest considerate caring and looking for partner to share
this life with.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />

what i have to offer:<br />
<br />
i'm happy. (i won't lay my unhappiness on you as something you're
not doing right.)<br />
i'm a loyal person<br />
kindness<br />
i'm emotionally secure and comfortable in my skin<br />
a good sense of humor (tongue in cheek...my ex wife still doesn't
get my humor)<br />
a heart that has been through enough to know what real love is but
not so thrashed that it cannot open.<br />
i am a scorpio...<br />
hmm...i'm pretty generous i give more than i get<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />

i believe everything pans out in the end so treating others as i'd
like to be treated is a core value i try to live my life by. i
generally don't mind being called out on things. i try to stay open
minded and earnestly consider different perspectives.<br />

i live in fairfax. i have an awesome 6 year old daughter that lives

so i've been told;) and a lot of fun. i really get energy from
being around people and sharing ideas. i am very easy to talk with
and open communication comes very easy to me... not to say that i
don't appreciate some alone time. i enjoy being around men that are
successful and intelligent (both are a big turn-on for me) but also
strive for a more balanced life style (but then again...doesn't
everyone?). i can be spontaneous but can also plan something down
to the last detail. i hope to meet someone who loves to engage in
conversation pda enjoy great wine different culinary choices
bring new and fun ideas to the table and doesn't occasionally mind
being spontaneous and adventurous but not too extreme...(without
having to jump out of a plane i hate heights!). the time has come

i moved to northern california from canada about 8 years ago. i
grew up in east africa and have lived all over the world (kenya
tanzania uganda nepal denmark england canada and the us). my
two favorite places are vancouver british columbia and the bay
area. i still want to travel but i plan to call this area home for
many years to come. i have an english accent (slight -- i think)
and speak very rusty swahili.<br />
<br />
i like to know what's going on in the world so i am a bit of a
news fanatic. i have a liberal point of view so listening to the
news can be a challenge.<br />

being outdoors whether running hiking or riding is an important
part of my life. i do my best to lead a healthy life. i used to be
a triathlete but retired after an injury. i've been looking for

discovered crossfit training.<br />

i have a 10 year old son that i love very much. he lives in bc
canada with his mother. i see him about every 6 weeks or so.<br />
<br />
i am easy-going and very open minded. i love to try new things. i
am confident and i enjoy making new friends although initially i
tend to be a little shy in social settings  perhaps this is my
english background. i am honest caring affectionate emotionally
available and a good listener. although most people would not
realize it i can be sensitive and vulnerable. i am not perfect. i
can be impatient (especially when driving).<br />

i have been described as a sensualist. i love good food and red
wine. i enjoy cooking as much as i do searching for a new

hi there! i'm a bit of a blend of disparate elements. one portion
of me is the consummate ubergeek : i design electronics for a
living (usually something that involves processing video and that
has me thinking about implementation of complex realtime algorithms
in very large very fast fpgas) but the important thing is the
aspect of creation. to me there's something immensely powerful
about starting with an idea in one corner of my brain and through
hard work and experimentation bringing it to life to fill some
purpose. it doesn't have to be electronics - it could just as
easily be carpentry (i've rebuilt a house in the past) but
electronics pays better.<br />

towards people who have spent serious time abroad - even better if
its part of their heritage (immigrant friendly).<br />
<br />
my background is fairly liberal and i lean towards npr - however i
don't get along well with people for whom argument and winning are
primary values. evangelism and intellectual intolerance are a major
turn off for me.",100000

i'm pretty laid back i think. people have told me that i seem
calm serene. i think that's accurate. but i am a virgo. and i do
have some control issues that i'm aware of... that i'm working on
;-)<br />
<br />
i appreciate my friends and spending time with them. the older i
get the more i realize my relationships are what bring me the most
joy.<br />
<br />
i value intelligence compassion mindfulness creativity
kindness self exploration open-mindedness honesty pursuit of
emotional growth and spiritual growth. promptness too i like
promptness. and and i'm beginning to think that happiness is a
choice.<br />
<br />
i'd call myself a homebody. but it seems i'm always being invited
to one thing or another and i tend to say yes a lot. though i feel
as comfortable staying in as i do venturing out. and i could be
talked into either most times.<br />
<br />
i use both sides of my brain equally well. though i've been a heavy
on the right side lately. i'm an investment analyst by day
somewhat reluctantly. i'm good at it. but the corporate culture is
stifling sometimes. my creative outlets include writing and playing
music for the moment. i think art is essential. a lot of my
friends are artists musicians or writers. and i am often
attracted to women who are creative.<br />
<br />
i am a bit of a sports addict. i watch and participate. i am a fan.
i do keep up on things via sportscenter. but i'm not obsessive
about any team or sport in particular. i like everything from auto
racing to futbol (american soccer). i'll go to an a's game or a
giants game... but i'm starting to feel more sentimental about the
giants the longer i live here ;-) i still love to watch the colts
play during football season.<br />

great friends and i'm quite confident that they would vouch that
i'm a great guy. and lastly i'm not on this site to hook up

they say that only 10% of what your saying is the words you use
and 90% of what you're saying is how you're saying it. this is
especially true in my case so when i write i tend to lose 90% of
what i'm saying. so if you're reading this take what you
understand and multiply that by 10. then understand that that is
what i'm saying not what you just read. i could probably go on
about myself forever if i wanted to but i don't i already know
about me it's you i wonder about. but if you want to know more
then you're just going to have to meet me. if you haven't already

looking at my pics. if you have made it this far you have somehow

now wondering if i have any wit or brains behind my smile. i do. i
have a wittle brain. i love to laugh and make others laugh at/with
me. but there is no free lunch so you will never know for sure
unless you say hi!<br />
<br />
i'm here for the same reason you are - to find that special person
that makes my heart beat fast. i would like to find someone that
makes me break out into spontaneous smiles because of random
thoughts of you! i know i am not a perfect person and i don't
expect my match to be perfect either. it is pretty simple i'm
looking for a woman to spend the rest of my life with someone to
be my best friend first and foremost. someone that can accept me
for who i am unconditionally - just as i would sincerely accept you
for who you are. if the right person came along i would like to
start a family and have 10 children (ok just kidding 1 or 2 is
fine). i'm comfortable expressing my feelings and i know that
communication is key in any relationship. we all age with time; so
ultimately what matters to me is how you look in your heart and
your soul. i'm a very upfront and honest person. i believe that
people are good-hearted by default sometimes to my
detriment.<br />
<br />
some of my greatest life experiences occurred when i lived in tokyo
from 1995 - 2001. i worked for a silicon valley company and was the
resident manager in japan. learning japanese and trying to survive
in a foreign country was a rewarding and fun challenge. i knew i
was going to be ok after i ordered a pizza for delivery over the
phone and it arrived as requested - without the corn octopus and
mayonnaise on it! my other adventures include being a human target
at spain's running of the bulls and taking salsa lessons during my
1 month visit to colombia (including san andres and cartagena).
climbing mt. fuji (twice!) and relaxing on the west coast of costa
rica were also favorites. i enjoy traveling and in the past year
have been able to take several trips to asia where i explored
india thailand cambodia vietnam and hong kong.<br />
<br />
my experiences overseas helped shape my personality and i am not
your typical american guy. i'm punctual and believe in doing the
right thing even if it is difficult. if i go to an authentic
japanese restaurant i still find myself bowing and saying ""thank
you"" in japanese. i was raised to be a gentleman including opening
doors (yes even after the 1st date) and throwing myself into the
path of oncoming traffic to protect an old lady (luckily haven't
had to use that move yet). i can cook and my special dish of
ratatouille was virtually unknown until that movie came
out....<br />
<br />
i'm self-motivated and self-made having worked my way through jr
college college and finally graduate school. although i've worked
and studied hard to get where i am i know life isn't just about
career and money. i like to have fun and not take things too
seriously. i relocated back to the bay area a few years ago and
would love to explore northern ca and the world with someone
special.",100000
"thanks for reading my profile. i intentionally wrote a lot to
give<br />
you a sense of who i am and what i care about.<br />
<br />
i have an extensive international background which has shaped
my<br />
personality to be very tolerant and open minded. i speak
several<br />
languages and have lived in 6 different countries. i am very<br />
ambitious and work with a lot of passion and intensity. i am<br />
motivated by making a big positive impact in the world using<br />
technology as an enabler.<br />
<br />
i love what i do for work. my job software development and
people<br />
management leaves me a lot of room for creativity problem
solving<br />
and a lot of planning and decision making. so when it comes
to<br />
vacation time or weekends i try to be spontaneous and not
over<br />
plan. i am pretty easy going and adaptable so i can have fun
just<br />
about anywhere. at work i am very good at spanning across
many<br />
fields and connecting people. i have strong opinions but it
wont<br />
hurt my ego to admit being wrong when i am given a persuasive<br />
argument. i try to learn constantly.<br />
<br />
i am fluent in farsi and italian and i know enough mandarin
to<br />
survive. i was born in tehran (iran) went to high school in
milan<br />
(italy) then went to university in toronto (canada) and moved
to<br />
seattle for work then took a detour and went to beijing (china)
for<br />
a few years to setup my software development company. now i am
san<br />
francisco and travel often to seattle to visit my family and<br />
business partners. that background has helped me experience
many<br />
different cultures and be able to relate to different people. i
can<br />
make new friends very easily and i can adjust to a new
environment<br />
quickly.<br />
<br />
i am good at listening and reading people's emotions. i find
people<br />
genuinely interesting. i am very logical and straightforward. i
can<br />
easily say what is on my mind. words or feelings do not have to
be<br />
dragged out of me with force. i don't play mental games and i
never<br />
intentionally hurt someone's feeling.<br />
<br />
what gives me satisfaction and motivates me is to make a
positive<br />
impact in the world. i am more motivated by solving the
systemic<br />
problems rather than helping specific people individually. i
much<br />
rather start the next kiva.org than to volunteer at a soup
kitchen.<br />
i have seen a lot of poverty in india and china and those
memories<br />
are very vivid in my mind. i feel a great sense of
responsibility<br />
to do something impactful in the world. i have been lucky that
my<br />
hard work has made me financially secure so i have the luxury
of<br />
taking bigger risks and hopefully have a great big impact.<br />
<br />
i am not religious at all. i don't need an afterlife god or
an<br />
external force to make me to do the right thing. i am very<br />
conscious of what is fair and just and i try to aim for them.<br />
<br />
i love hiking and open spaces. i am fascinated by camp fire! as
a<br />
child i was a pyromaniac and loved to experiment in my dad's<br />
chemistry lab. i am the eldest of 3 brothers. our parents let us
do<br />
a lot of building and engineering stuff as kids and that
ingrained<br />
in us a feeling of being permitted to explore the world and to
take<br />
risks.<br />
<br />
i am good at skiing snowboarding and water skiing. i used to
play<br />
squash and i love to get back into it again. i am very good
at<br />
swimming but i don't enjoy making laps around the pool anymore.
it<br />
is just too boring. i like doing sports rather than watching
them<br />
on tv.<br />
<br />
i don't think i have ever said no to experiencing something<br />
interesting. except for drugs i guess.  i have eaten duck
feet<br />
worms suspended in jello and fried scorpions; so it is safe to
say<br />
i can eat anything it. but now days i try to minimize the
amount<br />
of meat that i eat.<br />
<br />
i am very intellectually curious (somewhat abnormally). i
always<br />
have to hold myself back from asking too many questions from
people<br />
that i meet. i ask them about what they do and how they do it
and<br />
why and i secretly wish i could go hang out behind them for a
day<br />
and see it for myself. so naturally my preferred movies and
tv<br />
shows are documentaries or true stories. i read predominantly<br />
non-fiction books. i am fascinated by bio-engineering and by<br />
finance. i actively manage my own stock portfolio and i am
pretty<br />
up-to-date on macroeconomics issues. i have beaten s&amp;p500
in<br />
the past 10 years in case you wanted an objective measure.<br />
<br />
i love to have deep conversion with people and debate and
argue<br />
about politics business ideas policy issues science<br />
environment foreign affair etc. i find shallow conversations<br />
irritating and repetitive. life is just too short to waste
time<br />
watching tv and discuss sports.<br />
<br />
i am pretty fearless. i moved to beijing and setup my own
company<br />
and hired people and managed to build very complicated
software<br />
with very junior people. i didn't speak chinese and was very
naive<br />
about running a business in china. but the sheer determination
and<br />
energy that i spent over several years made the operation<br />
successful.<br />
<br />
i don't buy too many stuff that clutter my living space. i try
to<br />
live modestly and simply. if i have to cook i will mix
together<br />
everything i can find and then give it a unique name. i just
follow<br />
common sense cook books are too restrictive for my creativity.
:-)<br />
i think i do a good job but you can judge for yourself. as a
bonus<br />
i gladly load the dishwasher every day; for some reason i
find<br />
doing that to be relaxing.",100000
"the basics:<br />
<ul>
<li><br /></li>
<li>- i have good hygiene and chew with my mouth closed</li>

<li>- i am gainfully employed with a challenging career and don't
live in my parents basement</li>

<br />
now that we've established that i won't make you run screaming in
the other direction upon meeting me here are a few more
interesting tidbits about me...<br />
<br />
- adventurous - from sailing in the bay to backpacking in the
sierra. i also am equally at home exploring an art festival wine
tasting or shooting pool at a dive bar with a beer.<br />
<br />
- fun - you only go around once (no mulligans no do-overs) so you
might as well live it up.<br />
<br />
- intelligent - i am a college graduate and have a fairly wide
range of interests and like talking about almost anything. while i
can hold an intelligent conversation about most topics i'm not
someone who knows everything. (you know the kind of people i'm
talking about)<br />
<br />
- easy going open minded - there are definitely things i am very
passionate about but really very few things that actually bother
me and i'm willing to try anything once. (well almost
anything)<br />
<br />
- i am fit but you won't find me at a photo-shoot for the cover of
""men's health"" but i exercise regularly for the simple reason that
i would rather not have my physique ever limit something i'd like
to try.<br />
<br />
- non-douche - if you are looking for someone with a baseball cap
rotated 25 degrees wearing body glitter and/or copious amounts of
self-tanner a stupid grin annoying laugh and a popped collar
please move along. thanks.<br />
<br />
- i have been described as patient considerate funny (as in
""ha-ha funny"" not ""weird funny"") and honest. of course other people
have called me more derogatory things but i'll just gloss over
that for now.<br />
<br />
a few general comments...<br />
i'd rather play a sport than watch it i work with computers but
don't play video games i love to cook and make killer gnocchi . i
consider myself a very curious person and have a wide range of
interests - from tinkering to viticulture; right now my big hobby
is sailing. also i'm sure you've caught by now that i'm a tad
sarcastic. :)<br />
<br />
still with me? awesome. sorry if i sound a little conceited. i
almost threw up writing this.",100000
"the bay area has been home for 7 years now and it's hard to think
about leaving. originally from the midwest i'm pretty much at home
where ever i go and that means either spending the weekend getting
sweaty up on a wall in yosemite valley or tuolumne cracking brews
and grilling at camp afterward or staying in town and exploring
the urban jungle of sf or getting decked out to go out for drinks
with my friends.<br />
<br />
i'm pretty genuine and don't hold much back.<br />
<br />
some of my favorite activities are rock climbing snowboarding
hiking and camping so i'm pretty active and fit. but i also love
to go to napa valley ocean beach or take a quick road trip south
to play for day or two.<br />
<br />
i'm big on family and visit my parents at least twice a year and
they visit me here. family's important.",100000
"the dreaded self promotion box! let's see now just a guy going to
work to make money to pay my mortgage food habit and high end
bicycle parts addiction. it'd be nice to have someone special to
share some of the relaxing moments with. i'm a native san
franciscan born but not raised. i was raised on the peninsula
around woodside. i moved around ca for ten years before moving back
to the community i was raised in and bought a house and started my
own business. now i have these wonderful hills to ride right in at
my front door.",100000
"the more you experience in life the harder it becomes to summarize
yourself but i'd say that by now i have a good idea of what works
for me and what doesn't. i have a passion for art music food
travel and life in general. i'm constantly learning in many
aspects of life sometimes the easy way sometimes the hard way...
but either way the important thing is that i learned right?",100000
"the most important thing you should know about me is that i'm a
full-time single father to my eight year old daughter and that it
is fantastic. never knew life could be so lovely; never thought i
could love so fiercely. obviously i'm looking for someone who also
sees that she is value added.<br />
<br />
the second thing you should know about me are my friends. after my
daughter they are hands down the best thing i've got going. they
are an amazing group of people really tied into the city and the
world and we are always up to something worth the effort.<br />
<br />
the third thing you should know about me is that i am a wave rider.
when i see a plan i like when i'm possessed by a vision of how it
could or should be i can be single-mindedly inspired (and
inspiring). i tend to go for it.<br />
<br />
i should also mention that i'm not blasting out a bunch of emails.
so if i contact you i'm interested in you and you'll find that i
try to put a little thought into what i say.",100000
"the nicest thing anyone ever said about me is that i can see the
best in other people and make them better. i hope that's
true.<br />
 i'm a spiritual seeker/goofball/businessman/artist.<br />
 i make pretentious and insubstantiatable interpretations of films
&amp; music and encourage others to do the same.<br />
 i'm hyper-educated but casual and often silly.<br />
 not only do i know i have feelings i can talk about them.<br />
 i have been to over 50 countries - but never south america!<br />
 sometimes i'm subversive - but in a funny not mean way.<br />

college football game? what about a picnic west of the golden gate

i had a deep soulful examination the other day by an authoritative
expert - a medical doctor. the analysis was that i was soft

"the opposite of courage is conformity and i am most emphatically a
non-conformist.<br />
<br />
i am a passionate independent thinking intellectual person who is
filled with interesting ideas and a willingness to learn. i am
optimistic and romantic but not mushy. more likely to express my
affection through touch than words.<br />
<br />
i joke a lot and try to keep upbeat but underneath it all i am a
very serious person who has a lot of integrity.<br />
<br />
reasonably well travelled. lived in brasil for a few years. was
very successful in japan. studied italian for a month in
firenze.<br />
<br />
swim every other day walk a mile or two every day. taking pilates
and argentine tango lessons. excellent health. i weigh 167 lbs. my
age and photos are accurate.<br />
<br />
i have pursued varying spiritual paths during my life. i was raised
a buddhist/presbyterian and in the presbyterian church i could
sense the power and glory only when the choir was singing in this
old wonderful wooden cathedral. but the sermons were dessicated
boring and completely devoid of any true feeling. i have studied
many faiths and come to the conclusion that every religious
organization strongly attracts two completely different kinds of
people; one kind is full of the spirit and the other kind of person
is attracted to the money property and prestige. you can guess
which kind rises to the top of the hierarchy.<br />
<br />
divorced. my two boys are almost out the door (17 and 19).<br />
<br />
optimistic in outlook but i am not one to live in a bubble and
pretend all is well. i see the suffering of the world and it
bothers me greatly. i hate the waste of fighting all these wars
and find our goverment to be utterly corrupt and
self-serving.<br />
<br />
for the money wasted maiming thousands of our young men in
afghansitan &amp; iraq we could have put solar panels on every
roof in america and become energy independent. we should be riding
bicycles and walking to work but instead we make the oil companies
richer and richer. they don't even have a bicycle lane planned for
the new billion-dollar bay bridge.",100000
"the pressure is on. this is where i'm supposed to tell you how
wonderful i am right? my first attempt at creating a profile tried
to impress...in fact it was so impressive that when i searched for
matches my own profile showed up at the top of the list and i was
told i should message myself and ask for a date! ;)<br />
<br />
i will try a great experiment...being as honest as i can. they say
that honesty is the best policy but insanity is the best defense.
anyway here goes....<br />
<br />
i am a calm and gentle spirit and a seeker.<br />
<br />
what am i looking for? myself i suppose. have i been successful?
yeah i think i've found what i'm looking for. i feel that i have a
very full life and that i'm comfortable in my own skin without
being full of myself.<br />
<br />
i like <a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=reading"">reading</a>.
you'll rarely see me without a book.<br />
<br />
i like people. i'm a pretty good listener most of the time anyway.
however the flip side of that is that i don't have a lot of
patience for people who only talk about themselves and fail to
listen back. there are plenty of people like that but i don't seem
to attract them that frequently anymore.<br />
<br />
i like to think of myself as a good and loyal friend. many of my
friends are overseas and i'm not always the best person to write
but experience has thaught me that the best friends are the one's
that i don't hear from for a long time but when we meet again it's
like we never were seperated.<br />

i like <a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=animals"">animals</a>
especially dogs. would like to get a dog but i realize that my
life style is so busy that it wouldn't be fair to the dog. i
tolerate cats but can't say i like them alot. i suspect the
feeling is mutual. i adopted an amazon parrot a few years back.
he's amazing and more intelligent than your average nightclub

am fortunate to have a job that allows me to write. (update: not
currently the case as i'm currently working for myself doing
something else but i still get to write!)<br />

i collect <a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=quotes"">quotes</a>.
one of my favorite quotes is one by henry miller:<br />
<br />
develop an interest in life as you see it; the people things
literature music - the world is so rich simply throbbing with
rich treasures beautiful souls and interesting people. forget
yourself.<br />
<br />
if that quote doesn't embody me as a person it certainly describes
the way i try to live my life. i don't think he means that you
should forget yourself in a negative way...just not be to self
absorbed. experience has tought me that when i temporarily lose
myself in something it is when i really find myself.<br />
<br />
i've always been fascinated by different countries people and
cultures. i love to <a class=""ilink"" href=

myself but find that having someone to share the travel experience
with really enhances the pleasure. like my 88 year old dad says

"the quintessential young urban professional engineer (yupe) - like
a gen x yuppie but with the douchiness removed and replaced by a
hearty dose of ernstwhile midwestern optimism and naivete. i'm a
funny guy (take my word for it) &amp; make for a great conversation
partner no matter what the topic of the day is.",100000
"the real problem here is that most everyone starts off the same way
in trying to describe themselves which of course may be entirely
different than how others see us. i can't imagine that a paragraph
or two is going to give you a true idea as to whether we have
chemistry or a true connection...<br />
i will say that i am a very patient person who knows how to treat
people with respect and friendship. i'm complicated enough that you
won't be bored with me but not so complicated that if you wanted
you can figure me out. i love giving affection and romance to
someone. love trying new things seeing new things meeting new
things. pretty lame i know but a computer enhanced profile is
only the very tip of the person behind it. what it comes down to is
that if you find me even remotely attractive you should see if we
connect and spark. i have a lot to offer.<br />

if not good luck searching!",100000
"the simple version: i live a great life of both beauty and
profundity while pushing the limits of what my child-self thought
possible. i like to live life thoroughly...especially where awe and
fun like to dance. i love who and what i am as well as what i can
create in this world. i see life as a complex combination of
things but theater art music technology and passion are the
elements that get me the most enthusiastic.",100000

"there are a couple of quotes by alan watts that resonate for me
deeply:<br />
<br />
""things are as they are. looking out into it the universe at night
we make no comparisons between right and wrong stars nor between
well and badly arranged constellations.""<br />
<br />
""to have faith is to trust yourself to the water. when you swim you
don't grab hold of the water because if you do you will sink and
drown. instead you relax and float.""<br />
<br />
i am a searcher a feeler and a jester at heart. i am loyal to
friends and work and i look at work as play. i can be serious if
the situation calls for it however i much prefer a kind
lighthearted approach.<br />

"there are a few thing that i've learned in my short life:<br />
<br />
1. there's no worse feeling than that millisecond you're sure you
are going to die after leaning your chair back a little too
far.<br />
2. nothing sucks more than that moment during an argument when you
realize you're wrong.<br />
3. bad decisions make good stories.<br />
<br />
on that note my father once told me that at the end of my life i
would remember the experiences i had not the items i purchased. i
take this to heart each and every day and consciously put myself
into situations where i will have the opportunity to meet new
people learn new things or at least have an interesting story to
tell a friend.<br />
<br />
people always describe me as a ""nice guy"" and i don't see this as a
bad thing. i'm an excellent friend the first person people call
when they need a favor and always go the extra mile to help someone
out.",100000
"there are a handful of things i'm passionate about and that drive
me. the primary one is making video games. the thing i really love
about making games is that it's challenging both in an intellectual
and creative way and in the end i'm providing something fun for
people to do in their spare time. i'm lucky enough to have a job
that is this passion: it's very difficult but also very rewarding.
as a side note leadership is also something that thrills me--i
just found out from a new assignment.<br />
<br />
i also enjoy doing martial arts. it's a skill i started young that
has served me in many ways the most pronounced being that it
helped increase my willpower and discipline. those two things have
been invaluable in making my life go however i want. on top of that
it's handy for feeling safe in a wider range of circumstances
without relying on anyone and it's great for fitness.<br />
<br />
another love of mine is music. i play the drums i dance. i'm
considering combining my drumming with my martial arts and doing
taiko drumming because taiko drumming is awesome. i can get
totally lost in music too. it's not uncommon for me to be talking
to someone even someone i like and be compelled to dance to the
song that just came on. i also do karaoke a bit too.<br />
<br />
i also love meeting new people. i like throwing parties. i like
going to parties. i like introducing myself to random strangers at
bars. i like networking. every so often i meet someone i connect
with and that's a real gem. speaking of which approach me kindly
and i won't bite!",100000

facts: i'm going to my very first burn this year. i make iphone

"there should be something on this site that calculates how much
people know about themselves. to me it seems easy to know you like
travel and movies and all foods except sushi (which i love) but i

i've guess i've learned a lot bout myself but also know some easy
stuff like i don't like lobster (except the tails) and lately
started enjoying flan. i can't read much of anything without giant
pictures even though i love learning. i don't like to waste my time
much anymore and focus on art writing and making music... i think
being creative is one of the best rewards of being a person. i have
some incredible friends here in the bay and a chubby cat who loves
laying on my stomach.<br />

- i used to dance a lot would love to get back into it<br />
- i enjoy travel - both international and domestic<br />
- i am a ball of energy i have many interests pet projects and
always willing to try new things.<br />
- i'm career oriented driven and ambitious but i don't lose
sight of the most important things/people<br />
- it is important to me to feel like i'm living life to its
fullest<br />
<br />
<strong>here are the details:</strong><br />
i really enjoy spending time in the kitchen and am looking for
someone who will at least enjoy the end results but would be
really great to find someone who will also hang out with me in the
kitchen. dancing (salsa waltz swing hustle) was once an
important part of my life (at one point i was going dancing or
taking lessons 4-6 times a week) but work travel and not having
a partner has prevented me from going as often as i'd like. i'm
hoping to get back into dancing very soon.<br />
<br />
i enjoy travel and adventure as much as i enjoy board games and
intimate conversation (preferably over a glass of wine or a cup of
coffee). i enjoy motor bikes and sky diving (considering getting
certified) but wouldn't consider myself an adrenaline junkie. i
want to become a stronger swimmer biker and climber but have
given up on running.<br />
<br />
i spent the last 9 months working in tanzania where i had a
wonderful and rich experience but i'm glad to be back in the bay
area and am looking forward to getting reacquainted with all the
wonderful perks of the bay area.<br />

when it comes to relationships i really value fun low drama
caring balanced and stable ones - life's too short for anything
less.",100000

altitude. photography sports (playing or watching) inside jokes

ceviche french toast and/or bastilla recipe.<br />

favorite activities: inner tubing down cache creek exploring small
towns/back roads hiking in marin snowboarding. and
snacking!<br />

things i'm not a big fan of: wet socks crowds at the airport road
rage uni (sea urchin) stress fruit at room temperature and
partially hydrogenated oils or high fructose corn syrup (so i'm
told).<br />
<br />
i work in the city in online marketing but spend energy with my
other gigs - coaching volleyball and running a screenprinting
business. i run a youth volleyball club and work with a business
partner printing t-shirts sweatshirts etc. where i do most of the
design work.<br />
<br />
i'm good natured and patient but generally conflict-adverse when
it comes to highly emotional drama. i'm introspective seasonally
spontaneous and mostly presentable.<br />
<br />
i enjoy company that is relaxed open-minded and tends to be on
the goofy side. i like those who naturally tend to be smiling
those who generally rather go for a walk than a movie and those
who can laugh at me and themselves without feeling self-conscious.

i also love spending lots of time outdoors riding horses playing
writing and listening to music dancing until the wee hours
drawing learning/doing new things and i have a strange fondness
for the smell of old books and wet pavement.<br />
<br />
i'm no french chef but i am a decent cook. good food is a huge
priority in my life and is so much more than just something you
shove in your gullet to keep you alive. if i'm at a restaurant and
there's an item on the menu i've never had no matter how strange
or exotic that's what i'm having! phew! got through that whole
paragraph without using the word ""foodie""...wait...dammit!<br />
<br />
my job makes me happy and is something i'd do in my spare time for
free if i had to...and i have! material possessions don't define
who you are but certainly can be an indication of stability in
one's life. let's just say i bought my house in marin when i was 28
(make of that what you will).<br />
<br />
i'm fairly outspoken so ask me what i think only if you're willing
to hear the answer because i'll tell you in no uncertain terms.
which is really just my way of saying i'm honest (sometimes to a
fault). i've been known to go to extremes to get a laugh and given
that my sense of humor tends toward the off-beat (and occasionally
off-color) the overly politically correct may find themselves a
little put out. (hmm should i admit that?)<br />
<br />
it occurred to me long ago that stress and unhappiness can mostly
be avoided with a little clever planning and a large dash of mental
discipline. to that end you'll find me positive and even-headed in
almost any situation. i'm no pollyanna a little healthy cynicism
and sarcasm are no strangers but stress depression or emotional
malaise get you nowhere and thus are better left to others<br />
<br />
you'll find me at times playful and whimsical and at others
intense and passionate. i'd hope to be able to say the same of my
partner. an inclination for adventurousness and a willingness to
push ones self (physically and emotionally) are essential. without
these people stagnate pigeon-holing themselves into a single way
of being a single set of experiences they are forever doomed to
repeat. not good enough! there is so much fun and joy to be had. we
need only to stretch ourselves a little to step outside of our
tiny comfort zones to capture it.",100000
"third time on this essay stuff...i just watched a talk on the
importance of authenticity and i suppose that if their is place to
be it..this is it so..i am a cancer in every sense of the
sign..extrememy sensitive compassionate a romantic..i also am
easily driven into my shell but when i develop trust in someone i
thrive. i consider myself to be creative optimistic and love to
break into a song.. especially if it is something like elton john
or any cheezy pop.",100000

describe 10% of it would seem outlandish. yet it is the life i've
lived.<br />
as a boy i was a total nerd. i built rockets lasers robots. i got
into a fare bit of trouble. later i focused that energy into
playing waterpolo and played at berkeley. since i was 17 have been
traveling the world living in europe asia and latin america. i
sailed south east asia and was marooned on an island in the indian
ocean learning how to fish with a net and read nature's clues.
when i finally made it back i got my phd in string theory and
worked in academia for 12 years. now i look at large data sets and

"this is supposed to be the coles notes of my personality right?
you guys are lazy cheaters!<br />

alright here's the basic gist... i'm an artist not the starving
kind but rather the type that spent very little time exploring my
connection to the phallic symbol through oil painting (this
reference is actually based on a person i encountered in a terrible
ge art class in college). instead i worked my ass off so i can
build a career as an artist in the entertainment industry where i
get to draw paint animate and have a blast all at the same
time.<br />

not having to spend my days at parks trying to sell my ""the
abstract shapes are supposed to represent the struggle of man kind""

nothing better than a little foreign travel to put life in

different ways of living in my own neighborhood but inertia keeps
me in my routine. (perhaps you can help me with this?). i love san

software company in the bay area. recently i resigned and started
my own company which i've been planning to do for years. now all i
have to do is create something useful and sell truckloads of
it.<br />
<br />
i'm an information junkie and like to know everything about
everything. i get bored around people who can't converse on a
reasonable level or are unable to see beneath the surface. i also
have a sarcastic and somewhat venomous sense of humor; it took
rigorous self-taming to learn how to keep it within acceptable
norms (far from normal but acceptable).<br />
<br />
touch is by far my most dominant sense. i think 70% of my brain is
devoted to tactile sensations and the other senses share whatever
is left.<br />
<br />
i eat like a caveman most of the time - meat vegetables fruit
some nuts some dairy and no grains or sugar. i've always liked
eating this way but after researching nutrition for a while i now
have enough scientific evidence to give me a good excuse.<br />
<br />
i value liberty over security and equality and i like to earn what
i get and get what i earn. to a large extent these preferences
determine my view on moral and political issues.<br />
<br />
i say what i mean mean what i say and always do what i said i
would do. these qualities in my view are the basic qualifications
for being a man.<br />
<br />
english is my third language and i speak it with a slight
accent.<br />
i hope you like it; most people do :)",100000
"welcome! i'm mature but not without some passion for life. i love
kids fresh snow running in the forest talking about ideas and
plans seeing the world baseball under the lights.<br />
<br />
i appreciate people that take advantage of their gifts people that
aren't afraid to work hard to make something special happen and
people who know what they want.<br />
<br />
i prefer to eat healthy and spend more time breathing fresh air
than watching television but ice cream and a movie with someone
special sounds nice.<br />
<br />
i have a sharp dry wit that some find entertaining. i also have a
little girl. three years old. she's very cute and full of energy
and she means the world to me. =)<br />
<br />
you? i'm hoping you're honest humble outdoorsy and smart.",100000
"well done finding me! what were the chances? pretty slim that's
what. now the real test begins...am i able to accurately convey who
i am through prose while sparking your interest. i think i have
what it takes. but the pressure my god the pressure!<br />
<br />
on a warm summer night in the 81st year of the 20th century inside
the iron curtain of ukraine i was born. the world is still
recovering. fast forward a few years...i moved to the us when i was
six grew up in la moved to san diego for school got a job out of
college ended up saying in sd for about 10 years then decided to
live the dream and start my own company (in montreal of all
places). i lived in montreal for 7 months and eventually relocated
(both myself and my company) to san francisco where i now
reside.<br />
<br />
my philosophy in life is a mix of the golden rule (""treat others
like you'd like to be treated"") and a general belief that if you
do good things create value and do what you enjoy good things
will happen. so far so good. i also (warning: cliche approaching)
take life one day at a time. being an atheist (of jewish descent)
without any sort of afterlife to look forward to i want to make
the most of life today and am looking for someone to share that
with.",100000
"well gosh. if you're looking for just the top lines i'd say that
to know me is...<br />
<br />
to suffer a deluge of irreverent humor.<br />
<br />
to be sucked into one harebrained scheme after the next in one
country after another.<br />
<br />
to share earnestly and fully about aspirations feelings big
theories curious observations and little ups and downs.<br />
<br />
to enjoy multiple free lunches to make up for me being chronically
late but very well intentioned.<br />
<br />
to hear silly rhyming songs sung about you composed spontaneously
offered with a warm and open heart.<br />
<br />
to join a search for meaning and joy in ways expected and
otherwise.<br />
<br />
to embrace serendipity. cause man it's always done good by me.",100000
"well hello there! i'm high energy intellectual very creative and
attracted to women with the same qualities.<br />
<br />
i created my own web design company from the ground up. i'm an ivy
league grad (college and law school). i play the french horn and
write sheet music from movie soundtracks. and i'm writing a book on
how to be happy. i like entertaining word play and exploring the
mysteries of life.<br />
<br />
i'm originally from new york. i talk fast and think even faster.
ideas spring from me like wildfire. people tell me i'm a really
funny guyi can find something humorous in almost anything. once a
friend and i were trapped by the rain in a bus shelter and i kept
her laughing hysterically the entire time. so i dare you to meet me
for five minutes and resist the temptation to laugh (sometimes with
me sometimes at me). i'm very much a glass half-full kind of
guy.<br />
<br />
i'm also an avid hiker. i love walking in the green hills of the
east bay the tall marshes of coyote hills the evergreen trees and
beaches of the peninsula and the rugged cliffs of the marin
headlands and i go hiking nearly every weekend with my rugged
pomeranian mountain dog. i also enjoy bowling ping pong miniature
golf ice skating architecture walks and probably other
things.<br />
<br />
i'm really looking for someone who has a passion for some mentally
rigorous subject (either for work or hobby) in life. if you have a
passion for an art or a science or entrepreneurship we could be
a great match. if you're writing me for the first time you can
spark my interest with an unusual idea or query.",100000
"well here goes it. i'm just a drama free genuin non perfect real

"well i am basically looking for fun!!!!<br />

them!!! i am best at giving a wild night to that special lady for
the evening!!! no i am not a bum!!!! i have money!!!!<br />
<br />
i travel around cause i enjoy doing it and i was done with all the
bullshit back from where i am from!!!! so if you want to have a fun
night then say hello and i will reply.<br />
<br />

"well im 6ft 1 190lbs athletic body i am into riding motorcycles
and i am currently living in sf",100000
"well i'm new to the online dating scene but decided to give this a
try because it seem way too difficult to meet anyone serious these
days. i don't consider myself a club or bar type of guy anymore so
here i am thinking this might be the best place to actually meet
someone. i for one work odd hours that pretty much limits my
ability to really go out and meet people it's not something i can
do on a consistent basis. i rather find that one person that i can
hang out with instead of going out every night.<br />
<br />
a little bit about myself i'm a pretty easy-going laid back type
of guy. i try to enjoy life as much as possible and try not to get
too caught up with work so i'm definitely someone who looks for
balance. work for me is great and i love what i do however i
realize life is more than that and what's life if you can't enjoy
it. people usually see me as the ""responsible one"" and i think
that's because i'm determine be the best person i can be. i've
faced a lot of road blocks in life and it has made me the person i
am today someone who appreciates what he has and doesn't mind
working hard to get what he wants.<br />
<br />
family and friends are really important to me because they have a
huge impact on my life. i think i'm fairly intelligent base on my
job description and i can be pretty technical and nerdy at times.
besides that i'm also in the military reserves and i keep myself
in good shape however i've given up my dream to be a superhero if
only i had superpowers.<br />
<br />
i'm not the cheating type so i pretty much expect the same in
return. i don't play games and really want to find that one person
that is just as committed to making a relationship work rather
than pointing fingers.<br />
<br />
overall i think i'm a pretty normal guy. i understand that i'm not
perfect but who is.<br />
<br />
hopefully i didn't bore you with my life story but if want to
know more feel free to hit me up.",100000
"well shoot...just a country boy who made it big in the city. i have
had my highs and lows and am still alive and kickin'. not a day
goes by that i don't belly laugh and say something kind to someone
who needs it and it does come from my heart. love kids and dogs
girls who like to be romantic and good food. i cook  clean fold
and even find time to play!",100000
"well to start off in life and many other instances i like to get
both feet wet. actually i prefer it that way. i stay very active
and live a healthy lifestyle. live and let live. stay on the middle
of the road when it comes to most things; able to see things from
different views. smart. great problem solver esp. with
riddles...and will try and help anybody in need. loyal and
protective should be thrown in there as well. trying to avoid
reactive behavior and live to my central values.",100000

"well about me... i am of hispanic and a hint of italian decent. i
attribute my eclectic taste in music and food from having been born
and raised in san francisco ;-)<br />
<br />
why am i here? well i am embarking on another kind of adventure
one that's sweet strong and lasting. make me laugh and you've got
a shot. i'm part leader part entertainer. i love to take day
trips go to fairs but i mostly enjoy the healthy outdoors and
traveling. especially the tropics. i also enjoy being at home and
watching tv and snuggling up with that special someone. i like
movies and music of all kinds. i'm loyal to my friends and family;
the friends i had when i was five are still my friends today. i'm
mellow at times and at others high energy. the people i know both
work and home tell me i am really nice sweet positive and
forever smiling. hahaha. my closest friends tell me that no matter
what the situation i always make the best of it and some how
always make it fun for all.",100000
"well i guess i should just get the bad stuff out of the
way...<br />
<br />
i'm totally addicted to ice cream i usually couldn't hurt a fly-
but i'm definitely guilty of killing one or two spiders i cried my
eyes out when i watched ""the notebook"" i once saw britney spears
in concert (please don't tell anybody) i always seem to stay up
too late and i eat out way too often.<br />
<br />
but in my defense i do have one or two redeeming qualities. for
example: i always put my shopping cart back where it goes i try to
be really nice to restaurant servers i floss everyday (okay fine-
almost everyday) i can make a pretty mean pizza from scratch i
get to write and teach music for a living i got pretty lucky in
the family and friends department and i have a special knack for
always keeping an even number of socks.",100000
"well i'm enjoyable to stay around. i love making jokes for me
this is the best ice-breaker. my match has to be a fun person
someone that likes to travel and see new places. someone that i
could come some day and say ""hey lets go travel tonight?"". i like
to take care of my girl as i hug her and kiss her. my girl is my
world and the only person that i want to stay with.",100000
"well i've tried to be more factual and open in my ""self-summary""
but the cute jokes just sort of appear by themselves...<br />
<br />
1) i keep an unabridged dictionary under my bed and i know how to
use it (the dictionary that is).<br />
2) have ""pride and prejudice"" just about memorized.<br />
3) favorite bumper sticker: ""always remember you are unique just
like everybody else"".<br />
4) am listening to ""moby dick"" on my ipod not sure why but how
else can one make it through thirty pages of descriptions of the
anatomical differences between the different species of
whales...<br />
5) i'm still an incurable romantic.<br />
6) play jazz guitar badly. i used to be able to play the piano ok
i even attended a music conservatory briefly.<br />
7) i'll never tell you about a great ""cab"" or talk about visiting
the ""wine country"". these terms just seem pretentious to me.<br />
8) i've never been to prague and have no plans to do so although
that drops me out of the upscale man-about-town competition. most
people here seem to have been to prague.<br />
9) i've been to india... viewing the poverty and suffering is a
life-changing experience.<br />
10) i agree with bertrand russell's ""why i am not a christian"".
also with steven fry's amazing speech on the same subject.<br />
11) i am slender and strong.<br />
12) i am constant faithful and loyal.<br />
13) i sometimes listen to p.g. wodehouse stories on my iphone as i
fall asleep. hugh laurie says that p.g. wodehouse saved his
life.<br />
14) i have one ph.d. and almost have another. i just like
learning.<br />
15) i have had about 1500 ballet classes.<br />
16) i'm mostly vegetarian but not fanatic.<br />
17) i've never applied for a job without receiving an offer.<br />
18) i have worked for a two failed startups. not my fault.<br />
19) i have never told anyone ""it's your fault"". i don't believe in
that<br />
way of thinking. everyone tries.<br />
20) i'd so much like to have a partner for the (partner required)
acro yoga class on valentine's weekend. (all levels are ok).<br />
<br />
yoga is becoming my passion as i get older. i used to be a ballet
dancer and now it is yoga and running that is keeping me strong
and flexible. i love the bit of spirituality and sense of community
that is sometimes a part of yoga classes. i don't know much yet
about eastern philosophy but i would love to find a partner who
would be interested in finding out more about this. who will go to
bali with me for a yoga retreat?<br />
<br />
the most important attribute to me is kindness. and the kind of
unselfishness that shows itself a dozen ways in every day that you
spend with your partner. there are many other things that are
important to me like a sense of humor (how else can you keep your
perspective when things go wrong?) but i don't want to turn this
into a list. i can't resist adding one more ""trust"". trust is
harder to get then love it requires much more time.<br />

"well let's see. i grew up in the midwest and lived in the
southeast before making the journey out here three years ago. i
love the bay area and the weather that is like a fall day every
day.<br />
<br />
one of the things i enjoy the most is just taking a random walk. it
doesn't matter to me if i have a destination or not. i enjoy the
time just to think and relax. another added benefit is your
discover places you wouldn't ordinarily discover.<br />
<br />
i really enjoy traveling. it doesn't really matter where or when.
it doesn't have to be far at all. a random trip to the beach or
exploring the bay area makes me quite content. however i do like
visiting new places and meeting new people as i think it adds a lot
to the experience.",100000

of humor intelligence and maybe there could be a spark. guess the
only way to determine that is in person..",100000
"what did i miss? i have truly found this whole online dating thing
to be quite interesting. recently i was reading the portrait of a
potential date and i noticed that she had almost listed more deal
breakers than she had interests. i want a woman who is accepting of
others and tries to see the good in other people. whatever happened
to the old fashioned way of meeting a woman being attracted to her
and genuinely enjoying her company. not because she earns this
likes that or anything else of little value but because i feel good
when i'm with her. that's what i'm talking about!<br />
<br />
i am a romantic honest &amp; hardworking man with a good sense of
humor that believes the best things in life are free. i'd rather
spend quality time with someone special as well as family and
friends than laying around watching tv on sunday afternoon.<br />
<br />
i really enjoy the outdoors and exploring the area. summer is my
favorite season and i love anything about being in or around the
water.<br />
<br />
basically i want a woman i have good chemistry with that will enjoy
being with me and spending quality time doing whatever we both
enjoy.<br />
<br />
i believe that you can have different interests as long as the time
spent pursuing them is not excessive and you remain the priority in
each other's lives. i'm looking for a woman who knows how to have
fun and enjoy the simple things in life. she would be honest
intelligent romantic affectionate possessing a good sense of
humor and be emotionally available. ultimately she would know
exactly what she wants out of life be consistent and be ready to
pursue that goal.<br />
<br />
ok i do have a dealbreaker in this equation. i want a woman who
actually has the time and desire to have a relationship. not just
one who sits down at the computer and crafts a portrait thinking it
will magically change her life. it won't unless she puts the time
and effort into building a meaningful relationship with someone
special!",100000

qualities that i am looking for include: creativity sexy
goal-driven educated interested in traveling and witty.<br />
<br />
just bee yourself.",100000
"what would a match for me be like? given that what i'm looking for
reveals a great deal about me and qualities that i value (or at
least attempt to cultivate) in myself ..let's talk about
you.<br />
<br />
you're a man comfortable in his own skin who operates from a place
of authenticity acts get old but you are more interesting than any
facade. you're adaptable and flexible yet apply a strong sense of
integrity to your interpersonal relationships. you understand that
communication is key to mutual understanding and hang in there even
when there is conflict. you've got your life together but aren't
afraid to make some shifts for the right person. you're open to the
possibility of a relationship (note: if you are looking for
something not in the context of relationship i think the search
tools on this site can help you locate that. it isn't here.)<br />
<br />
you're emotionally mature but youthful in outlook....dancing
music painting cooking...you enjoy your creative outlets. you're
curious about the world able to entertain lots of ideas
cosmologies and theories without needing to proselytize - most
people walk around with their minds all made up....but for you on
some issues the jury is still out.<br />
<br />
you consider yourself intelligent educated respectful
considerate of others' feelings a man with good boundaries who can
articulate what they are.<br />
<br />
you know how to have fun laugh and step out a little beyond your
comfort zone in the spirit of adventure. you're a great
storyteller love entertaining and being entertained.<br />
<br />
you are resolved with your past. you won't spend our first date (or
first few dates) telling me all about your ex wife her vocation
favorite cuisine etc. (yes that should seem obvious but you'd be
surprised.) we've all been there - but with you your ex is
emotional history and not a current event.<br />

if most of the above resonate with you and you've been reading this
nodding yep sounds like me... then i'd like to hear from
you.<br />

btw: eva is an alias i just like the name.",100000
"when i am not working on a plan for world peace i work in
marketing for a san francisco based company. in my spare time i
like geeking out to indie rock and kqed (weird i know). i'll also
dabble with my guitar from time to time or head outdoors to get in
a game of soccer or tennis. i am attracted to girls that are
intelligent and can discuss anything from politics to the
sound-track of the latest wes anderson movie. i like bars more than
clubs but i do like shaking a leg when sufficiently
intoxicated...err i mean inspired.<br />

i am an audiophile witty and a good dancer",100000
"when i was younger i was searching for a worthy adversary to
challenge me and keep me on my toes. imagine the difficulty in
finding that wrapped in an attractive successful fun
package!<br />

however i find myself looking at things from a very different
vantage point these days. yes i'd still like to find someone with
massive desirable traits but the the order of importance i place
on these traits has changed a bit. the person i choose should
complement me not challenge me (i mean not in a bad way). he
should be able to make me laugh think and feel completely safe.
life is short so having fun and being happy is what it's all
about. dancing traveling cooking golfing windsurfing and
writing are a few of my favorite things. i am prone to having
sarcastic tendencies and happen to think i'm the funniest cutest
thing under the sun - so be gentle when planning to burst my
bubble. the one thing that i am not proud of is the fact that i'm a
total hypocrite. my preference is a guy who has never been married
who does not have kids. i am financially independent and i would
prefer someone similar<br />

i love fast cars and chances are if you're a speed demon i'll
probably out-drive you! i like watching sports especially ufc
love the water eating is my passion and i love to laugh.<br />

intellects? i come equipped with both.<br />

started; i am an engineer by day working on the thermohaline belt

normal depending on your definition of normal?<br />

i spend my time reading books articles while listening to music
and ingesting coffee threw my iv. i will say that i drink way to
much coffee ... i find there is never enough time in the day to get
everything you want done and thats why i do drugs. just kidding. i
enjoy what i do but find it hard to balance leisuresleep and
business. some days its business and leisure with no sleep. on
those lucky days you will find me inhaling emergency vc
packs.<br />

event that you happen to be at the right place right time and
said the right things. how do you say you are a nice successful
guy without being an ego maniac? and future soul mate. perhaps the
proof is in the pudding. cheezy huh? well here goes.. i'm a proud
person accomplished amazing obstacles in my life. my parents were
refugees from way back when without a penny and settled in atlanta.
i'm led to think that i came out okay given the circumstances and
youngest of 3 siblings. so where am at now in life? it's still a
mystery to me. my passion in life lies in the amazing people that
surrounds me on a day to day basis. the positive vibes motivates
and drives me. thus i have predominately put my career on the
forefront. i have traveled extensively in the last 2 years since
being inspired by a documentary called 'a map for saturday'. just
like how i decided to move to this amazing city san francisco from
atlanta i bought my first round trip ticket and 1 day of prep
embarked on my first international destination to thailand and
cambodia without a place to stay until landing. since i have
covered the ancient ruins of macchu picchu in peru salsa dance in
medellin colombia (home to the deceased drug lord pablo escobar
you know that guy) back packed through budapest hungary and
partied like rockstars with friends in istanbul turkey.<br />
<br />
there's a lot more traveling i want to do historical places in
europe in central and south america but i'm holding back until i
meet someone hopefully here to do it and experience with. my
friends says i am hopeless romantic. and that chivalry is dead. and
to that i respond with a laugh and a wink.<br />
<br />
friendship is not out of the question it's welcomed! my job it's
not glamorous. heck if you ask anyone they'd laugh at my
occupation. okay so i create video games for a living. yes that's
right for a living! it's challenging much like a movie studio
spending months on the next summer blockbuster. it's a similar
hoping that in 4-6 months my fruits of labor and dedication will
be enjoyed and entertain the millions around the world. i'm not
married to work. i'm making time to learn swimming and move on to
scuba diving cooking classes learning a new language hiking and
taking my slr around the city to snap some wicked cool night
photos.<br />
<br />
about the one i'm looking for... i smile thinking of you. when i
walk past your favorite store wanting to buy you that expensive
purse that you pointed out but never got for yourself. i surprise
you with a much needed vacation and nice dinner. you act younger
than you look. while i do enjoy mature women i like that you know
that you have not forgotten how it is to be a girl. cute and sexy.
that will eat my home cooked dinner (i try but we can order take
out too).<br />

anyway i've been in the bay area almost 15 years now after growing
up in sac. i got tired of people saying how great sacramento is
you know... with the river and all so i moved out ""west"" and been

got something for everyone. i've explored all parts of sf and have
stories that will put any ""shock and awe"" campaign to shame!<br />

some things i enjoy... giants games great restaurants wine
festivals action movies and other ""guy"" stuff. traveling is
something i do a few times a year. i'm currently looking for a
travel companion who isn't afraid of exploring those little areas

just staying home and enjoying a movie or watching one of my

i moved to san francisco from philadelphia in the summer of 2009
after finishing my medical training in philadelphia. i moved here
because i have family here (my sister brother-in-law and niece)
and because i really like the area! i missed seeing sunsets when i
lived in philly.<br />
<br />
i can't say enough about this area! one weekend i'm on this
incredible hike above the fog line and watching reflections of pink
and orange off the cottonball-like clouds from the sunset. the next
weekend i'm roaming around north beach china town and jackson
square on a city-wide evening treasure hunt with an amazing
chinese new year parade and coursing through fascinated crowds.
this city just has a mystique to it.<br />
<br />
i've got my career. i've worked hard to get to this point and i
think i lucked out too. i'm making some good friends in my new
city. ultimately i'm looking for a partner now with whom to share
adventures and perhaps even stand in line with to get ice cream at

"""i never saved anything for the swim back"". i don't settle and
neither should you. i have good balance in most things. i work

things but also plan for the future. i like sports and art indoor
and outdoor activities. i can dress up or lay around in sweats. you
get the picture. best of all i can be counted on and trusted.<br />
<br />
i am passionate about waking up every day and about anything that i
decide to do that day. it is kind of my defining characteristic. i
give myself fully to whatever it is that i am doing.<br />
<br />
i want a woman that i consider to be my best friend. she would be
someone that i would want to share everything with. any experience
would be great by itself but better if she were there to share it
with me.<br />

i really do treat people the way that i want to be treated. i call
when say that i will i don't flake i tell the truth i am very
thoughtful i am a great communicator and i am open about what is
going on and how i feel..etc. i grew up in florida and went to

in ca since 2001. i was also in the military at one point.<br />
<br />
important: i don't believe in blowing people off standing them up
or flaking in general. it is important that my date shares these
ideals.<br />

furthermore i am not looking to date a million people. i am happy
to meet as friends if you are looking to expand your social
network but i am looking to date someone that has potential to
build into something real.<br />

great song. i heard bob at the indy in early june (again) and love
this song particularly.<br />
<br />
of course i've faced my share of challenges. but generally i feel
really hopeful about all of this. love. life. the world. where
we're all headed. and i feel lucky. like when i look out my bedroom
window and see the sun setting behind the golden gate bridge. when
i think of my job which is intellectually-challenging creative
and allows me to solve a variety of strategic problems. also when
i think of my amazing friends (which i think of as the family i've
chosen) who are sweet and edgy and funny and solid. and when i
remember the places i've traveled and the people who've shown me
kindness and taught me about courage and work and
connection.<br />
<br />
of course i've learned lessons from trials as have most who've
lived a few decades but even most of these are worthy and valued.
i understand the importance of love. i value challenging my fears.
i love a sense of connection and plenty of laughter.<br />
<br />
so write me. if you feel lucky... sometimes... too.",150000

obama and i share the same birthday august 4. we are both huge
lincoln buffs (i weep every time i visit his memorial). in the
2012 we will both be vampire slayers. each of us will be
exorcising the devil from our own parties. that is a bit of a
stretch for me since i just registered republican for the first
time in my life a few weeks ago. (i have never voted for a
republican in my life). i made this historic switch in honor of my
illinois mentor from the civil war and to tip my hat to some of
the recent republican presidents who have preserved the spirit of
fdr (who i believe was a lincoln republican in democrats clothing)
(such as nixon  ford reagan and george bush 1)<br />
<br />
********************<br />
<br />
i am running for congress this november against pete stark and
someone i have never heard of. i deliberately skipped the primary
to run in the general election as a write-in candidate and i am
going to...how do we say this politely...kick his butt. (pete is an
old friend. he and the mayor of fremont in 1996 were the only
elected officials to endorse me in my inaugural campaign where i
defeated a mormon conservative (sound familiar?) incumbent on the
school board assuring a progressive majority).<br />
<br />
since then in 2006 and 2010 i successfully won campaigns for
alameda county (ac) transit board of directors by 60% of the
vote.<br />
<br />
i have never lost a local election.<br />
<br />
is this david vs goliath this time? don't be so sure. pete's
district has been redistricted and not in a good way for him
having to swallow more conservative pleasanton. this ivy
league-button-down-collar-graduate (moi) can look pretty
conservative if called upon. and pleasanton/livermore is not
dominated by religious rightists just (mostly) caucasian middle of
the road horse riding cayenne-mercedes-infiniti driving soccer
mom and dad types who never set foot in oakland.<br />
<br />
so here is my strategy:<br />
<br />
<strong>1. i am setting a goal of making sure that 100% of eligible
voters ages 18-29 are registered to vote.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>2. i am going to find an oil company (perhaps with your
help) between now and the end of october who will commit to joining
tesla gillig bus company of hayward and ac transit to finance the
building hydrogen fuel buses and cars at the nummi plant in
fremont. (fyi-ac transit has 10 such vehicles in its fleet and have
been driving them between 3-5 years without any serious issues.
they require liquid hydrogen as fuel and they pee out water
through the exhuast type.) if this happens great jobs return to
fremont. the nummi plant will be replicated in michigan and
throughout the country thanks to the deep pockets of the oil
company. goodbye internal combustion engine.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>3. i will take no special interest union or business
money. i will take money from superpacs who support causes that
improve the planet. i get to decide what money i deep and what i
turn back.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>i like raising money it sends a message to my competitor
not to mess with me but frankly i don't plan to much of
it.</strong> maybe a campaign office party some friday night by
taking out inn-n-out burger. my campaign is 100% ground - just
listening and talking - an 0% aerial (mailings radio tv ads). i
plan to do a fair amount of performance art/improv at malls to grab
some attention.",150000

i make my living as a professional sailor. i own four sailing
companies and am a sea captain. my best qualities are that i'm
really a great dad a creative man caring loyal and romantic as
hell. i have 3 kids that mean the absolute world to me.<br />

worked hard to make a great living doing what i love.<br />

i'm comfortable in my own skin and do exude a certain confidence.
comes from my occupation and generally my self-reliant attitude. i
live my life like it's my last day on earth. i've traveled far
sailing all over the globe and met some wonderful people on those
travels many of whom i know to this day.<br />
<br />
my education was in music and i played my way through college. i
still play in a band and we exist simply to create original songs.
we don't gig much preferring studio work to live performance.
probably because it can't pay nearly what we make in our
professional lives.<br />
<br />
i have a lot to offer. i'm easy going non-judgmental funny and
gregarious. i don't smoke don't do drugs (drug testing) but i'm
not specifically not against them. i drink socially and am a bit of
a fitness nut playing competitive level racquetball 5 times a
week... 3-4 major tournaments a year.<br />
<br />
i'm 6'3 195 lbs brown hair green eyes.<br />

i'm politically central left; spiritual but not religious.<br />

i am romantic fun and fit<br />
<br />
here's my idea of a date (definitely not the first date :-)<br />
<br />
====================================<br />
a date idea<br />
<br />
i imagine a foggy day. driving out over the coast range a light
mist glazes the windshield. we're quiet holding hands content.
even though it's cool and damp we have the top down. a lovely
piano piece is on the stereo it's wafting melodies swirling about
the car like the wind that moves it.<br />
<br />
we're dressed casual. even in casual dress you are alluring
provocative..very sexy. you wear slacks and a sweater. the fabric
of the sweater is ever so soft. it accents your body in a way only
a man can appreciate. the sweater clings to your skin caressing
every part of you...following your every move.<br />
<br />
we driving down a wandering highway towards big sur. tall redwoods
surround us. it feels safe secure. wind flowing music playing...a
perfect moment. peaceful<br />
<br />
up a meandering path we walk towards a beautiful a-framed
building. it's the lobby of a small and very romantic resort. a
narrow walkway runs high up a hill. on the mountainside are
treehouses built high up in the redwoods. on the cliff side are
the hill houses literally dangling off the cliff. walking by the
swimming pool we are transfixed because it appears that the edge
of the pool facing the ocean simply drops off to oblivion. it
turns out that the pool is built into the cliff as well. the water
spills over the oceanside edge and creates a 15 foot waterfall
below.<br />
<br />
we walk into our cliff house sitting high above the sea looking
out over wave after endless wave pulsing towards the shore. the
sky is gray but the wind is warm. one whole wall of the house is
windows. no drapes or curtains. the ocean is the drape. no one can
see the inside of the house but the sea lions hundreds of feet
below.<br />
<br />
the main room is filled with handmade furniture that looks as
though it was carved from the local trees. there is an elevated
four-posters bed with a down mattress covered with a thick
comforter and dozens of down pillows.<br />
<br />
across from the bed is a huge hearth style stone fireplace. the
fire is crackling and warm and smells like fresh cut wood.<br />
<br />
the bathroom has the most unusual hottub. it is built of stone and
glass with the side facing the ocean built entirely of glass. ...",150000
"(i'm not really as obnoxious as my profile suggests i just use it
to keep the riff-raff out ... wait no i've been informed that i

exclusive: i'm a tech geek with an obsessive-compulsive streak for
working out; i'm pretty good with both chess pieces and
motorcycles; i can tell the dirtiest jokes you've never heard but
am amazingly good with children; i love playing sports and hate
watching them; i can fix your computer but still kick your

i get paid to come up with ideas that's a good thing too.<br />

interest in my profile:<br />

1) my nationality is british and spent my childhood there so when
we go to london we could have tea with the queen. (i am an
optimist).<br />
<br />
2) i just took a one and a half year sabbatical from work and
sailed my 38ft sailboat from san francisco to sydney australia.

4) my ethnicity is east indian and i can cook a mean curry for you!
or we can go to yoga together and i'll give you even more street
cred.<br />
<br />
5) my career is important to me but i realise it's a means to an
end. it provides the financial means to pursue passions dreams
and nice dinners with my soulmate!<br />
<br />
6) born with a rucksack on my back and have more than fifty stamps
in my passport. whenever and wherever you want to go traveling my
bags are packed.<br />
<br />
7) while i enjoy hitting the town i am also happy cuddling up and
watching movies especially movies based on true stories!<br />

8) i enjoy following current events and reading non-fiction and
have some sort of opinion on nearly everything. so if you like good
conversation on many topics start the conversation by clicking
send a message.<br />

- if you send me a message then you *will* get a response. it
might be just a thank you but i consider it only polite to respond
to an initiation of personal communication.<br />

think we're a good match for dating and all the rest of it. it
could just be that i think you're an interesting person up for a
conversation without assumptions.<br />
<br />
- i consider online dating very much a theory vs practice thing. in
theory this is great because you get to find out the important
things about someone *first* as opposed to six months into a
relationship as you might with someone you met in the pub. in
practice this isn't so great as people can act badly and
unaccountably . so let's have a little more of the theory side eh?",150000

did a lot of back-packing throughout europe and mexico. more recent
trips to europe have been more refined and that works for me as

i am a programmer by trade but don't let that get in the way ;-).
unlike many of my fellow coders i am quite social and enjoy the
company of others. i love adventures. there is nothing quite as fun
as exploring an abandoned building in an urban environ. i am
curious about everything. i am constantly learning. i enjoy meeting
new people and then getting to know them. i have been told i have a
big heart. i have very blue eyes (that i'm told are quite dreamy).
i am not athletic but i do work out regularly and pitch in a
softball league to try and stay healthy and fit. i know quite a bit
of local san francisco history and can regale you with tales of
past and show you where those tales took place. i am an officer at
the san francisco elks lodge #3 (it's not just for old people
anymore!) i tend to use too many exclamation points when i txt or
im people! i've been known to sing karaoke on occasion. i don't
like raw onions in my food (cooked onions are just fine).<br />

my name is luke i live in berkeley work in san francisco running
an amazing space! i am of the caucasian breed. i have short dark
hair deep blue eyes a scruffy face (usually) and am a fit from
surfing rather than the gym kind of guy. i love being outdoors and
enjoying life. we are here to do that!! i am really looking for a
good friend and someone to explore fun times with. i am very sex
positive and open sexually. i love group sex that involves multiple
men and one woman and more so i really love masturbation. i think
its amazing to lay in bed or stand up with a woman and show off to
each other or watch a movie with each other or even just tell one
another sexy stories! i like natural women. i am not a fan of make
up and even really razors for women to be honest!! (if you shave
your legs and armpits and stop there...thats fine too :-) ) right
now i am finding myself to be very solo sexed. i am really only
looking for someone that wants to have the best friend they could
ever have and loves to masturbate with someone. i am craving
finding a mutual masturbation partner.<br />
i am just putting this all out there because why pussy foot like
the rest of the mens profiles. i am a real person with real
thoughts and like being real so you can make up your mind based on
the true person not the one that will hop out of the closet in 6
months that you have to fall out of love with if thats not your
taste!! so cheers to being open honest natural and real!!<br />

"hello!<br />
<br />
for some reason most people think i'm a yuppie-type when they
first see me. this is not exactly accurate;i spent 6 years touring
in a band full time. i work with insane (literally) people who
often want to kill me. i will curse on our first date. i will make
you laugh. often and hard.<br />

my goal in life is to self-actualize. obviously that is an

interested in anyone trying to make the world a better place.<br />

curiosity about life and am constantly trying to cram everything i
can into my brain. i communicate freely and directly and like to be
with others that do the same. if i like you i'll tell you and i'll
call you the next day. you're welcome to do the same. i'm not here
to play games and i'm not afraid to bring up awkward or
uncomfortable subjects; i think there is a lot of room for growth
in the midst of difficulty. that being said i also value just
""being"" and strive to find balance between the part of me that
struggles with the meaning of existence and the part of me that
wants to just sit on a beach and drink beer!<br />

i'm normally outgoing and socially adroit smart  both
intellectually and emotionally. unfortunately ""dating"" doesn't fall
into the above for me. i become shy tentative awkward and clumsy.
sometimes i wish we could just skip straight to the third date
where everyone is already comfortable. :-) but the good news is
that it does pass!<br />

do something active  <a class=""ilink"" href=

date"" ... :-)<br />

cruise director was my unofficial title at a company for which i
used to work. and in my neighborhood they refer to me as the mayor

together in social situations  athletic outdoor events followed by
food and drink being my favorite. i feel very lucky in my life.
i've made amazing friends who are very important to me.<br />

treat clerks well even when no one is looking."" that's stuck with
me for years and i think is one of the best rules to live life

though sorry!). also just recently started doing cross-fit because
i am a glutton for punishment i suppose. aside from all that i
enjoy everything the the city has to offer... sports movies art
restaurants a good manhattan spending time with friends etc... i

love compassion passion and find that special someone.<br />

i am not use to meeting people on line but my sister has found
true love not once but twice in her life through a dating service
so with her encouragement i have decided to try it for the first

more adventurous travel included afghanistan and senegal for work
and galapagos and papau new guinea for live aboard scuba vacations.

mutually nurturing friends with whom i share hiking biking
running going to see live music and quiet dinners where i can
hold my own on life's back stories or the interiors of good
books.<br />
<br />
i meet people spontaneously and am quietly self confident. i have
traveled extensively for the pure pleasure of seeing things often
with a (significant) other but when my life path dictates happily
on my own.<br />
<br />
i want a man with a map even if it is not completely linear who
doesn't fear the forks in the road that life creates. a sparkle in
the eye and an inner sense of humor are the keys to my heart. i am
prepared to give fully but not frivolously.<br />

i want to meet someone with a physique born of an athletic life
style but not a body sculpted in a gym in front of a mirror.<br />

i am athletic and pretty and i am proud of that but i do not wholly
define myself by those features.<br />
<br />
physicality as a benchmark of attraction is an easy enough
yardstick and i certainly don't ignore it. sharing the adventure of
it all with someone looking beyond the horizon with humility;
willing to look inside for the truth leaves me breathless.<br />

i am not by temperament judgmental. i don't view compromise as a
sign of weakness. that said my experiences have shaped me. i am
aware of where i have been and have a solid sense of who i am and
where i am going.<br />

london) workout read watch mindless television and stay in touch
with my friends. i fully admit that i am skeptical about online
dating and think that revealing too much in an online profile takes
away from the mystery and fun of dating. a few vitals - i'm
originally from oregon went to ucsd and then emory for law school.

south marin. i have two brothers a younger one who followed me out
here and lives in marin and an elder who remained in florida.<br />
<br />
my goal a match. my reason for wanting that is probably the same as
yours: with a little help from our friends an unshared life can be
great fun once you've mastered the art and yet is not to be
compared to life and memories shared with one who is dear to you.
it's better with a girl. a lot better.<br />
<br />
off the job my passions are in no order: 1) history - western civ
and us all periods. much of my reading is related to history; 2)
travel in europe - most of my vacations have been spent in europe
or nyc. i am open to traveling in other areas but am drawn to great
cities; 3) art and the history thereof - particularly painting one
of the reasons for my interest in european travel; 4) movies  a
buff; all types except action films and animation; 5) shakespeare 
i'm trying to set up a shakespeare reading club. if i succeed it
will by my third; 6) food and drink  convicted hedonist; 7)
politics and foreign affairs - if you don't enjoy politics these
days then you just have no appreciation for farce or perhaps i
should say tragi-comedy. my politics are center-left and i'm about
as moderate as that sounds except that i regard far-righties as
hicks and ignoramuses. 8) music  intense lover of almost all
types including the american songbook but not post-eighties pop
or anything resembling rap; 9) humor  all forms not just
republicans though we do owe them so much in this area; the genius
of stewart and colbert and maher. 9) this above all the
conversation of friends. love to meet yours.<br />

"i am deeply committed to a path of consciousness having had many
experiences in my life that enrich and guide who i am as a man and
as a person. i initiate and create memorable learning experiences
for others and have a strong tendency toward leadership in the
venues in which i operate. i am more jungian in my orientation than
any other particular lens of looking at self others and life. i
am a seeker of understanding all and everything. buddhism sings to
me although i am not a practicing buddhist.<br />
<br />
i have two wonderful children aged 8 and 19 from my previous
marriage. my ex and i are very good friends and work extremely well
together in our co-parenting.<br />
<br />
the capacity to hold both openness to discovering all that is
available in life and to act in integrity are important tensions
that guide my life and something i seek in others. i am above
all a truth teller and a truth seeker. i am very emotionally
available but not always. sometimes i retreat into myself and
then come back easily. i am not perfect by any means but seek to
be fluid in myself and with another. i have a strong capacity for
compassion. in the little prince the fox said: ""it is only with
the heart that one can see rightly. what is most essential is
invisible to the eye."" i share that perspective and seek to live it
actively.<br />
<br />
i seek a woman who is strongly grounded in herself is wise and
heartfelt. i welcome rich exploration of the unconscious. deep
connection matters a lot to me. what we do together matters less
that how we do it. i seek a soulful life rich with exploration and
mystery. i like women with strong inner character who know who they
are and what they want. i also love a strong dose of the feminine.
these two extremes are not easy to come by and yet i welcome them.
looks matter to me but not too much. inner beauty matters much
more.<br />
<br />
i believe that a committed relationship is a powerful crucible for
transformation when both parties enter into it with a strong desire
for growth learning and inner discovery.<br />
<br />
i am not so much interested in what you do for a living or what you
like to do in your spare time. i love to go to tropical places too
and take walks in the rain as much as anyone. what i am deeply
interested in knowing however is whether you are a woman with a
strength of character able to enter into a soulful deep and
completely self-honest relationship with another. i find myself
attracted to a woman who is willing to tell me she is upset with
me and to simultaneously own that her upset is a reflection of
herself. while she does that i open myself to facing that i have
done something to trigger the upset and there is great learning
there for me. do you have the ego strength to join me in being
curious about how we are both attached to a point of view and that
our attachment intermingles with one another such that we are in a
pattern the cause of which is both our own ""stuff"" and even
perhaps forces that have shaped couples from time memoriam and
that we are simply playing out a stream that we had no choice in
the matter? and can you join me in dancing between those two
possibilities knowing that we can never know fully which is true?
i'd like to meet a woman who cares less about entering a cave in
kauai hi and more about entering the mystery. and by the way
these are the same qualities i seek in all my friends both men and
women alike.<br />

everyday. when the sunrises i tend to have a smile on my face and
approach the day with a can do attitude. a very strong cup of
coffee seems to help.<br />

i truly love camping. i believe there is only bad clothes not bad
weather. i am not the kind of woman who will wait for you to pop up
the tent i can do it all by myself. besides getting the tent up i
can whip up the best meal you have ever had under the redwoods.
grilled whatever it is you like if you are a vegetarian i can
grill some awesome tofu. oh you eat meat? i can make a tasty steak
with caramelized onions and marsala mushrooms. oh you don't eat? i

you i only need about 30 minutes to get ready . references

great if we enjoyed some of the same activities. such as skiing
hiking gardening going out to live music sailing and of course
camping. while i will love spending time with you i will respect
your need to have your own time to do some of the things that you
love. i think it's important to spend time together and time alone

well traveled (four continents thus far) multilingual (spanish

famous ones) at home in my garden (my bok choy is growing a little
<em>too</em> well--it's a little worrisome frankly--i fear it
might take over the local government) and in the pool swimming
laps. i'm a voracious reader (no really i often walk out of the
library with 8-10 books and finish them within a couple of weeks)

mccullough's book on the panama canal started me off) food
politics (lots of michael pollan) and all of the recent ""hot""

"i grew up on the east coast but my family originally comes from
louisiana...and that kinda sums me up right there. by the time i
was ready for grad school the whole new england/ivy league thing

attention and i needed to be in a place where things like music
food multiculturalism and good old-fashioned open-mindedness were
front and center. northern california -- the bay area in particular
-- was the answer and 20 years after arriving i can't imagine
living anywhere else.<br />

neighborhood the cat is happy (as is the part-time dog) and i'm
at a point in life where i'm lucky enough to be able to do most of

restaurants i check out lots of new bands and films and festivals
and trailheads. i have lots of friends who join in on this
stuff...but at the moment there's no significant other. which isn't
the end of the world for me (i have a pretty strong independent
streak) but isn't my preference either.<br />

there are few things better in life than clicking with someone
where the chemistry's right; if it's worth pursuing i think you

things but more importantly: she definitely needs to be smart
have a good sense of humor possess plenty of energy and enthusiasm
for life and be a thoughtful and sensitive person. it's great if
we share lots of the same hobbies and interests but i'm not sure
that's quite as critical as connecting in terms of our core values
and priorities. bottom line: i want to be with someone who has a
good heart and they can expect the same of me.<br />

and activities and i strive to become that kind of person
myself.<br />

"i have been in the bay area for 11 years so it is now home after

fluent in japanese (both written and spoken).<br />
traveled the globe extensively (over 50 countries) including
trekking across bhutan smoking a hookah in iran and just chilling
in havana.<br />
at the end of 2003 i left a great job at nokia (i was heading
corporate strategy for the asia pacific region) to pursue a
lifelong calling to become an entrepreneur. i haven't looked back.
it has not been easy and shouldn't be. my startups have won many
awards but have not made me rich yet. presently i am working at a
very cool startup while running my own on the side.<br />
an important part of my life is my 4-legged son tora. he's a cute
old english bulldog/shar pei mix.",150000
"i have jumped off he corporate ladder and have never looked back. i
have spent a lot of time over the past 9 years building my business
and love what i do.<br />
<br />
i like smart people who can relax and laugh about themselves and
the world around them. i really like dive bars camp fires and
dinner parties. i can fit in at stuffy events but generally like to
avoid wearing a tie unless it is a wedding or funeral.<br />
<br />
i love the outdoors and feel like finding the perfect trail can be
a near religious experience. the same goes for a great live show or
an amazing sunset at the beach.<br />
<br />
and beyond that i like all the typical stuff such as wine dogs
long walks on the beach beach sunsets kittens (but i am
allergic) travel to local and exotic locals and of course
grandma's apple pie. but then who doesn't.",150000

this comes from.<br />

i'm living in san francisco and working as an attorney. i enjoy
spending time in the city eating playing and checking out
different places. i dig researching and as a result know a bunch
of facts that are helpful in random situations. i am trying to
travel more to try more new things new food and new places. i
like to keep busy because i feel unproductive otherwise. it's a
blessing and a curse.<br />
<br />
i like to share as well as listen and if you're into art museums
theater fashion and appreciate simple things in life i think
we'll get along great! friends characterize me as fun-to-be-around
and easy-going. i have an enjoyable sense of humor and enough wit
to make it through all kinds of encounters. i'm physically-fit with
a hearty appetite. i am rooted secure and i'm happy with my life
but i'm missing that special partner. i try to be efficient.<br />
<br />
my ideal partner would be like me in some ways - a mixture of
stay-at-home and go-out/adventurous. routine can be good and bad -
it's important to not get stuck or bored but that comfort you can
feel with someone is unparalleled. i enjoy being impressed and i'm
attracted to the unassuming type. looks are not everything but
chemistry is important! i find that i'm most attracted to the
easy-going/fun-to-be-around girl.",150000
"i have two main passions in life that i truly love: food and
traveling. i have rarely met a dish that i have not liked and over
the years i have enjoyed a number of vacations and business trips
that have taken me to many amazing places around the world.<br />

when i'm not on the road or in the air i really enjoy exploring
the local bay area to find new restaurants that serve a variety of
delicious cuisines. they don't have to be fancy or anything; in
fact some of my most memorable meals have been found in places
that can be best described as the classic hole in the wall!<br />
<br />
while i'm definitely a go-getter at work and really enjoy what i
do in my personal life i'm much more laid back. life is too short
to worry about anything and everything. my friends would probably
tell you that i'm a pretty independent kind of guy who can be on
the quiet side at first. but once i get to know someone a bit more
and feel like we have some things in common it won't take long for
me to start talking about all sorts of subjects.",150000

1. at work i'm a hard working individual. i have a serious
business-like attitude as its a must since i meet with high level
executives of many fortune 1000 companies.<br />
<br />
2. when i'm off of work i'm a total kid at heart. i love to laugh

i'm really high maintenance.<br />

automobiles by giant corporations who care about us that's the
only sustainable future.<br />

 i'm one of 4 children<br />
 from the midwest originally but don't ever want to live there
again<br />
 my favorite way to unwind is to drink a couple of tall glasses of
red wine and watch netflix<br />
 you'd be annoyed by how much i'm on my computer<br />
 i go on one ""out of my comfort zone"" trip every year. last year
was vietnam<br />
<br />
don't you just really want to date me now? say hi.",150000
"i know it's a lot to ask but...<br />
<br />
i want to meet the perfect girl and have the perfect date. i want
us to feel that instant attraction the first time we see each other
then talk all through the night. i want us to talk about everything
that matters and most of what doesn't. i want to tell you how
computers work and have it be the most interesting thing you've
ever heard even if you could have cared less 10 minutes earlier. i
want to make you laugh harder than you've ever laughed and just
watch you and realize that you are the most beautiful person i've
ever met. i want to talk about music and play my favorite songs for
you and have you love them right away. i want to lose track of time
and see the sunrise together then the sunset then fall asleep
together because we refuse to be apart.<br />
<br />
i want to spend all my time at work every day trying desperately to
be productive but it's impossible because i keep thinking about
when i can go home and be with you. i want us to talk about our
days and really care about it. i want to sleep at each others
houses every night and not remember the last time i slept alone. i
want to make love and have sex and fuck and do things that words
aren't passionate enough to describe. i want to not see my friends
or family for months at a time because i'm at home in bed with you.
i want to know your body better than you do and have more than i
ever knew i wanted.<br />
<br />
i want to fall in love and argue about who fell in love first. i
want to see you every day and never get tired of it. i want to
listen to sappy love songs and think that nobody has ever had what
we have. i want our friends to become friends with each other
because they end up spending so much time together. i want us to
talk about the same silly things we talked about when we first met
and have it feel even more intense. i want going to the store to
buy food to be the happiest moment of my life just because you're
there with me. i want people to forget who i was before i met you.
i want to find you more beautiful with each passing day. i want to
love only you. i want to make each other better people.<br />
<br />
i want you to propose to me because you're tired of waiting for me
to find that ""perfect moment"". i want to buy you that ring you said
you didn't want because we don't care about things like that and
for you to make all your friends jealous just like you said you
wouldn't. i want us to sneak off and get married just because we
can't stand the wait but plan that big wedding anyways. i want to
play music with you at the wedding even if you have to learn to
play. i want to do something arrogant and macho like parachute
into the wedding in my tuxedo and everyone to roll their eyes
except you--who finds it very sexy. i want to never again have a
regret because i'd be terrified that if i changed even something
small then i might not be with you<br />
<br />
i want us to have children and get old (you can stay young if you
want). i want us to care more about our children than ourselves
but secretly we'd pick each other if we had to. i want to be more
in love with you when i'm 80 than i was on our wedding night. i
want to sit around bragging about our children to our friends and
occasionally travel to italy and buy a villa and live there for a
while. i want us to hold hands on rocking chairs and get frustrated
at children for stomping around on our pristine lawn.<br />
<br />
i want us to survive long enough for medicine to find a way to keep
us alive for centuries. i want us to live together so long that
anti-aging technology is advancing faster than we're getting older.
i want to download our minds into an massive internet and live a
lifetime every hour until the heat death of the universe. i want to
forget life and humanity and time and existence entirely and just
bask in your presence until i am nothing else.<br />

"i saw someone asked what breed of dog would you most closely relate
to and why. i liked that question so i will use the description of
the english setter to describe me:<br />
<br />
this breed's standard temperament is best described as a ""gentleman
by nature."" however it can also be strong-willed and mischievous.
english setters are energetic people-oriented dogs that are well
suited to families who can give them attention and activity or to
working with a hunter where they have a job to do. they are active
dogs outside that need plenty of exercise in a good sized fenced-in
yard. inside they tend to be lower energy and love to be couch
potatoes and lap dogs that love to cuddle. they are good around
children.<br />
english setters are very intelligent and can be trained to perform
about any task another breed can do with the exception of herding.
however they are not always easy to train as their natural bird
instinct tends to distract them in outdoor environments. their
temperament is considered a soft one. therefore they are very
sensitive to criticism and could be unwilling to repeat a
behaviour out of fear to disappoint the trainer. positive
reinforcement training methods therefore work best for english
setters.<br />
<br />
i had english setters for years. their behaviors' rubbed off on
me.<br />

what i am looking for?<br />

"i seek the unexpected to live life fully and experience
everything yet strive for balance. friends describe me as
eccentric and colorful but above all a good person with a good
heart. i work to be present in the moment and create memories to
hold onto. i work hard because i enjoy the effort and like the
impact and the freedom that results from creating something of
value. i'm a social creature. i'm a scientist and an adventurer. i
like to connect with people of all stripes. i get along with most
everyone but i tend to gravitate to people that i can share a
passion with a laugh an adventure witty banter or a
scintillating conversation about art life satirical cartoons or
what is (or should be) the next major goal in our lives.<br />
i have an absurd side  i enjoy doing things i've never done
before even if it's ill-advised or slightly insane. my first
answer is usually yes. the goofy things balance out the
serious/ambitious part of my life and it all unfolds with an ever
present soundtrack playing somewhere in the background. where ever
i am whatever i'm doing music is present in some form.<br />
there's a lot of dichotomy in my life. i love the city and its
vibrancy. but sometimes i need the middle of nowhere to contemplate
the universe and take a breath. travel off the beaten track is a
constant feature of my life. there is always good coffee good wine
and good conversation shared with the people i care about.<br />

priority for me. i am not looking for someone that wants to truly
be hurt or degraded (though someone that enjoys playing with
pain/pleasure dynamics is most welcome). i am not interested in
re-creating any prior trauma. rather i am looking for a great
relationship with someone that happens to be trustworthy yet kinky
and insatiable. i enjoy verbal domination restraints spanking
role-play/dress up giving sexy assignments and most other forms
of kink. watching/hearing/feeling my partner have an orgasm (and
another and another....) is one of my favorite things and you will
be well rewarded for the ""work"" i make you do.....<br />
<br />
face pic and answers to any questions available upon request. as
well please write something when you approach me. this dynamic is
sensitive and requires very good communication. if you're shy or
hesitant that's fine - just say so! i will guide you in assessing
what you're looking for and will be very gentle in getting to know
you. however multiple one line responses indicate to me that you
are ambivalent or are unable to communicate your needs and wants to
me - which is paramount as i will only enjoy this if i'm also
making you feel very very good.<br />
<br />
also please note that i am typically not the dominant type that
will totally overpower you from the first sentence or the first
meeting. don't get me wrong - once trust is established i can be
very aggressive am very strict (when we're in this mode not
outside of it) and will thoroughly and completely dominate you
when we're engaged in this style of play. however i have to know
that you will keep yourself safe with good limits and boundaries
for this to start to blossom. i can only participate in this type
of behavior when i know that you are deriving great pleasure from
this. as well i also like to mix some gentleness in with things.
nothing enhances the sting of an ""almost too much"" slap to the ass
like this sensation being interspersed with soft probing fingers
and words of encouragement whispered in your ear.....<br />
<br />
i have a very active albeit dark sense of humor and will laugh at
anything - including myself. i enjoy finding humor in human
behavior and the sociological implications of the things around us.
oh and people falling down is always funny too!<br />
<br />
all limits and boundaries will be respected at all times. there is
no negotiation on this. ever. i will carefully assess what your
limits are and gently but firmly guide you into the gray areas that
we want to explore. this is for your safety and mine. i refuse to
contribute to anyone's trauma or low self-worth. how will i do
this? i will ask. a lot. i will check in with you. a lot. once
trust is established this will diminish though you always have
the option of stopping anything at anytime. however if you don't
have the patience or attention-span to endure this at the
beginning i will annoy the hell out of you. i assure you if we
click that we'll get to the point where you walk in the door and
i grab you by the hair and take you mercilessly but that will not
be until i know that it's safe for you to engage in this
behavior.<br />
<br />
please excuse the douchebag/ wife-beater photo it's the only
somewhat discreet pic i have right now. i normally don't walk
around in a wife-beater....promise!<br />
<br />
as for ""normal"" activities i'm a voracious reader travel often
go out dancing often engage in intellectual (or silly)
conversation watch smart engaging and/or funny movies/shows and
work hard to bring good quality health care to under served
individuals and train the next generation of health care providers
to do the same. i feel strongly about social services and if you
don't understand why someone would want to work with homeless
bat-shit insane people (that's a medical term - look it up) even
if you wouldn't want to we probably won't get along. if i love
taking care of some homeless dude that wants to stab me in the
eyeball think of how well i'll take care of you!",150000
"i want to fall madly and passionately in love with a thoughtful
articulate and passionate man who can be my cherished submissive
lover and life partner all wrapped up in to one.<br />
<br />
d/s to me is not about bedroom kink but rather how we relate to
each other as a couple 24/7. as we walk down the street holding
hands we will to most look like a vanilla couple but we both know
that underneath your clothes you are wearing a cb-6000 to which i
am the key holder and that our dynamic is based on an explicit
exchange of power.<br />
<br />
i do not believe in female supremacy and do not think of my
submissive partner a less capable or valuable than myself. i have
zero attraction for a man who claims to be a slave without limits
and with no desire other than to please me. i want a man who is an
active partner in our relationship and who is able to clearly
articulate his desires and emotional needs and limits - expecting
to have them respected and taken in to consideration by me as i
lead our relationship. being dominant is not about my selfishness
but about my authority.<br />
<br />
i am a 48 year old scandinavian professional woman with a quick
wit keen intellect and a sometimes razor sharp mind. i like to
think that i am playful a dependable friend a good listener and
that i have a great sense of humor and am fun to be around. i would
describe myself as a strict caring and nurturing dominant with a
devilish laugh and strong sadistic streak. the archetypes that i
most identify with are those of the teacher goddess and
amazon.<br />
<br />
i have a strong intellectual curiosity and drive to understand
myself and people around me; to that end i can be very tenacious
and if you are not yourself committed to self-introspection and
emotional growth then you might find me a tad overwhelming. i
really want to get to know you as a person your thoughts your
fears your dreams and passions. what your kinks are will only
matter to me once we have determined that we are compatible as a
couple.<br />
<br />
i am a one-man-woman and come from a country where there isn't even
a word for dating exclusively. in sweden if you ask someone for a
date it means you are not seeing anyone else and that is what you
will get from me. if you are at a stage where you want to just
casually date or ""play the field"" rather than focus on getting to
know one person at a time i kindly ask that you pass me by.<br />
<br />
i strive to live my life according to buddhist teachings which
among other things includes attending meditation retreats
workshops and maintain a vipassana practice. i am seriously
committed to a path of self-discovery and i would want my partner
to also embrace a spiritual path although it might not be the one
that i am taking. my spiritual practice is all about being mindful
and present in the here and now; especially when things are
challenging. by choice i do not drink alcohol but don't mind a bit
if my partner does as long as it is in moderation. any type of
recreational drugs however is a deal breaker as i would love for
my partner to also be committed to being fully present.<br />
<br />
i am a voracious reader and addicted to npr and audiobooks. i
rarely miss this american life prairie home companion; say's you

fit.",150000

ask me a question and you'll always get an honest answer. i tend to
wear my heart on my sleeve and my thoughts on my forehead. i love

important. i believe in the 40/40/20 rule. 40% of time at work; 40%

running is important to me but i don't expect my partner to be one.

easy going and like to laugh a lot. i like to be spontaneous.<br />

troublemaker streak as it tends to get me invited back to dinner.

my life including some great british rock music on my ipod and
some cote d'or chocolate in my kitchen. you'll also find everything
from a tux to a wetsuit in my closet. however not everything has
to be a grand adventure. i try to make the most from every day

something to smile about. for example i'm an amazing singer. in

think and that's probably what i'm looking for most from a person.

varied interests in music art philosophy foreign languages and
cultures or other substantial pursuits. should also be willing to
have a bit of fun and not take everything too seriously -- ""humor

expectations.<br />

bad boy: being more street smart than book smart.<br />
good guy: shabby education: bs wharton mba uchicago (the bad boy
got in here somehow with his humor)<br />

bad boy: being very passionate about everything including
you.<br />
good guy: not being afraid to reveal my vulnerability (in a
confident way) such as being rescued by the us coastguards after a
too passionate windsurfing incident<br />
<br />
bad boy: building incredible chemistry with you on 1st date and
inviting you to my place for ""ice cream"" dessert.<br />
good guy: on first date finding out who you really are deep inside
and hopefully build an amazing emotional connection with you.<br />

bad boy: eating at a nice restaurant and taking you to a romantic
place with a great view afterward and taking you in the car.<br />
good guy: cooking a delicious and romantic meal at home for you or
behaving while eating with your friends or parents.<br />

slipping myself in<br />

<br />
that said i *am* looking for a long-term meaningful relationship
that will eventually lead to marriage and a family. on a related
note my first time around i was married to a single mom and was
truly blessed to have an amazing relationship with two incredible
step-sons (who are now awesome young men are still very much in my
heart and who i remain connected to as much as possible). through
being a step-dad and in being an uncle to two amazing nieces i am
100% sure i want to be part of a family with children again.
ideally i would prefer to meet someone without children and start
our own family; but i would definitely consider a ""modern"" family
again if the circumstances were right (no continuing custody
battles no anger issues toward your ex etc.) and if our
connection was strong enough to make a real go of creating and
keeping a family together... my next time around is for ""keeps""
:-)<br />
<br />
me: i work my butt off pretty much at everything i do. i am
passionate about building a business that will provide me and my
family with both comfort flexibility *and* balance. i know that my
hard work today will pay off when i want to take my family on a
month vacation to europe or asia one day. i am a bit of a startup
junkie and am both working at a startup (running operations --
which in this case means pretty much everything) and have started
a new company with a few friends (ideally this will turn into my
last ""job"" one day :-).<br />
<br />
i am also passionate about giving back to the community and am
working with some other friends to start a new charity. somehow i
also make time to directly volunteer to work with children at
organizations like variety children's charity and playworks. with
all of that going on i still make time for friends and family.
family is very important to me so i do spend a weekend every month
or so with my family (my parents retired from new york to las vegas
and my sister and brother live in vegas with their families --
including one niece each :-).<br />
<br />
i do all of the ""usual"" things people put on their profile: travel
movies dancing eating out hiking biking running cooking
snowboarding swimming etc. i am *not* obsessed with anything in
particular and prefer variety to any specific activity over and
over (not sure if i will ever run a marathon; but i'd like to try
for a half one day). in a word i like to be super active and feel
healthy by keeping myself in shape (without obsessing). i believe
that physical fitness is a key ingredient to mental and emotional
fitness...<br />
<br />
i have traveled around the world (45 countries so far) speak
russian (relatively well -- though quite rusty) dabble in a number
of other languages (a little german spanish thai cantonese and
even a few words of vietnamese -- usually enough to make people
appreciate the effort or get me in ""trouble"" when they respond
thinking that i am fluent ;-) and believe that seeing the world
helps you truly appreciate that there is so much more out there
than we get to see here in the us. i have a long list of places i
would like to go (and some repeats); but i also know that the most
fulfilling trips are best shared with someone special...<br />

with a scavenger hunt all over le de la cit in paris in search of
comt cheese saucisson and bien sr une baguette. our other
friend would supply the wine and champagne. we met at the edge of
the island overlooking the seine. the sun began to set as we dined
on meats cheese and wine on this most glorious autumn day in
paris. it was truly memorable birthday but most of all it was
better than celebrating at a mexican restaurant wearing a giant
sombrero.<br />
<br />
hopefully that story gives you a gleam into my personality. i love
travelling food wine and experiencing different cultures. i
don't particularly enjoy tourist attractions. for me travelling is
my way to see the world through a different pair of eyes and
realize there's more to life than my little corner of the planet.
my other great passion is music. i've devoted an entire room in my
house to be a music studio and to house my vinyl record
collection.<br />
<br />
career-wise i reached a good amount of success at an early age
but i feel i sacrified some of my personal life during that time.
now i'd love to meet someone special and be in a relationship and
eventually start a family. my first niece was just born a few
months ago and it's an amazing feeling when i hold her and look
into her adorable face and can see some semblance of myself.<br />

i'm often watching classic movies or rocking out to music. once my

definitely a big fan of trying new restaurants. recent favorites
have been zero zero zare marlowe and hogs and rocks. i'll eat
and try almost anything at least once even some of the stranger
items on the menu. i also love spicy food and i hate it when
restaurants don't believe that i actually would like the habanero
salsa (insert any other hot sauce here) in mass quantities.<br />

i also love attending cal sporting events (esp. football games)
giants games and sports in general. i have a past streak of
getting far too emotional at cal football games. i'm working on

definitely made things better in my sporting universe.<br />

i've recently gotten more into running and i just finished the
giant half marathon in august. i'm planning to run the u.s. half in

my typical route is along the embarcadero and through north beach
but i keep trying to find other parts of the city for good runs.
yes i do wear the toe shoes (they're called vibram five fingers).
yes i know they look weird. yes i do sadly love them.<br />

tahoe is probably my favorite place in the world. vegas is a close
second. both do involve gambling - namely craps blackjack and a
bit of poker. as for tahoe i love to ski in the winter and hang
out at the lake in the summer.<br />

i'm a damn good catch. unfortunately i've also realized that i
deserve the same and i'm no longer willing to suffer through a
mediocre relationship. i really don't mind being alone so the
person i'm looking for will have to add more to my life than they
take away.<br />

i have a lot to offer. i'm intelligent capable financially stable
and responsible yet i'm goofy fun emotionally intelligent
caring and yes good looking. i'm well traveled well educated and
clever. i read. i play well in many many different worlds. i'm
equally at home in a 5 star restaurant and a no-star bbq joint. i
am open to anything. i've got a good heart but a prickly exterior.
i'm brutally honest. i'm extremely easy going slow to anger and
never violent. i've been called more buddhist than buddhists but
it's not true. and no i'm not a hippy. i go to burning man but
i'm not a burner. in fact i don't think i've ever been pigeonholed

but you get the point.<br />

sure i have my flaws as well ask me some time and i'll give you
the details.<br />

probably the largest issue for me in terms of relationships is that
i need to find someone i can admire and respect as well as who i'm
physically attracted to. you don't need to be wonder woman but you
need to be good at or passionate about something. i've got my shit
together and you should too.<br />
<br />
personality wise.. if you know anything about myers-briggs i'm an
intp. i'm pretty heavily t and p. this means i make decisions with
my head not my heart and i'm more of a live-and-let-live than
judgmental type. i don't really understand jealousy and usually
don't show a lot of emotion. i recharge by being alone not by
talking about it. it's absolutely critical that you understand and
are ok with that.<br />

i know where i'm going and what i want in life. i think i know how
to get there - but even more importantly i'm enjoying the ride. i
can seem jaded to some because i'm a tad cynical but i'm probably
one of the most optimistic people you'll meet.<br />

my time is valuable to me and i've learned to spend it only with
and on people i really care about. these people are few despite
having a huge number of acquaintances. the people i care about i
will do absolutely anything for but usually they are the kind of
people who don't need it. i don't believe that vulnerability is a
strength but i believe that truth is.<br />

"let's start honest:<br />
<br />
i'm not for most girls on here. i was raised by and believe in the
old school definition of man.<br />
<br />
i eat meat i have scars i get a black eye from time to time (i'm
a boxer in a gym not a fighter in a bar) and i can clearly
distinguish between intelligence and wisdom.<br />
<br />
because of that i have several older friends (70+ year olds) that i
meet for a glass of whiskey and conversation a couple nights a
week. listening to them speak about life has validated my - i'll be
a man and you be a woman - pov.<br />
<br />
if that makes you think of a caveman i suggest making some older
friends and listening (a lost art) to them speak about life over a
glass of whiskey. there's another breed of man you may not have met
yet. older women swear by him.<br />
<br />
here's what it means to me:<br />
if i ask you out i believe i'm suppose to have most things planned
out. i'm not a lets split the bill guy. i open doors for people -
especially older people. i say please and thank you but can
convince a mugger to stay on his side of the street with a
look.<br />
<br />
i'm not afraid to admit that i make mistakes. i apologize quickly
when i'm wrong and i listen when someone tells me that i've hurt
them.<br />
<br />
i take care of myself. i have an amazing mom maybe too amazing. i
think one of the best things about being in a serious relationship
with me is getting to know her.<br />
<br />
i've been told that i am a surprising contrast: i look a wee bit
like a hooligan but lucky enough to live more like the
bourgeoisie.<br />
<br />
if you're smart (biggest turn on) confident fun and attractive
you will likely win one of the four following date options: 1)
meeting for a drink 2) going to see a show 3) making fun of your ex
while we have a nice dinner or 4) knocking over trash cans while
riding beach cruisers down empty streets in the wee morning
hours...<br />
<br />
sound good? good! now hurry up and send me an email. other girls
have read this too ya know.",150000
"let's switch it up here's my self-summary in haiku form:<br />
<br />
dance is my outlet<br />
never tried it? i'll do it.<br />
canadian eh!<br />
<br />
if you've ever seen a guy in full costume running down the street
and it's not halloween if you've ever been blinded by the
electronic light-up shirt of a guy dance-battling at a dive
bar...there's a good chance it was me.<br />
<br />
the movie ""yes man"" describes my general life attitude pretty well
though i'm not sure it's a good thing to be analagous to a jim
carrey character. i seize every opportunity to try something new.
groupon is like crack to me i suspect my friends of staging an
intervention soon.<br />
<br />
for example new things learned in the past month:<br />
- glass-blowing<br />
- photography basics<br />
- taiko drumming<br />
- if someone in the tenderloin asks if you ""like to party?"" say
""no!""<br />
<br />
i love this city (aww yea you know it's on when i type in caps)
because of the variety of fun things to do and i'm looking for
someone to share in my passion who doesn't take herself to
seriously. my pet peeve is when people list ""hanging out with
friends"" or ""good conversation"" as a hobby. those interests are
only a step more exciting than ""breathing"" or ""bowel
movements"".<br />
<br />
answers to the stuff you're wondering:<br />
- yes i'm employed with a good job and my own place. i ""have my
sh*t together""<br />
- no not crazy i just like to do random things<br />
- yes i can be romantic too. i could date you so hard your mom
will feel it...seriously.<br />
- it's short but thick.<br />
<br />
*warning: i'm canadian which means i pronounce ""out"" as ""oot"" like
ketchup chips (you don't even know what those are do you?) and
have a bronzed statue of celine dion that i carry with me at all
times. but it also means i'm generally amenable and won't attempt
any type of hostile takeover without asking politely first.",150000

"lifelong hardcore technology entrepreneur computer geek world
traveler foodie and seeker of new experiences.<br />
<br />
i escape for spontaneous travel adventures often. give me big
cities- the energy diversity and endless activities. i prefer
walking everywhere exploring neighborhoods close up seeking out
offbeat attractions along with fun unique restaurants and shops.
i'm lured to more gritty areas in my quest for interesting photo
opportunities. boston nyc dc seattle or chicago are favorite
destinations for spur of the moment trips to take in a modern art
museum catch an improv or theater show or checking out the live
music scene. i have visited 23 countries so far which still leaves
172 left! looking at thailand for my next big adventure or maybe
shanghai to see where my father grew up. costa rica is a regular
stop that i usually get to at least once a year.<br />
<br />
i'm a complex individual who is brilliant yet flawed generally
even tempered/mellow quite open minded and non-judgmental and
accepting of others all while being cynical as heck. i have learned
to thrive by feeding my adhd mind what it needs- brain candy in the
form of intellectual challenges sensory stimulation learning of
new things experimenting/tinkering and figuring out how complex
systems works. i'm a hunter gatherer and if you expect me to be
your farmer then we will starve.<br />
<br />
i have no choice but to be an entrepreneur as i suck at being an
employee and will invariably get fired eventually. but i learned
that i really do love to start businesses and grow them from the
ground up. nurturing them along at each stage just like raising a
child. i need them to either be wildly successful or go down in
flames. mediocrity is not an option and taking risks drives me. i'm
fourteen years into my 4th business which does it consulting. it's
big enough now that i have earned a lot of freedom and the days of
insane work hours are distant memory.",150000
"lifted from my match profile:<br />
<br />
i am recently widowed (about a year and a half now) guy trying
this world of technology for matters of the heart. my career has
been primarily working in the research labs for major silicon
valley high tech companies. i am a rather laid-back fellow with a
quiet intellectual take on things. gentle a pretty good listener
an accepting soul. i work in and around nerds all day but i don't
feel like one. though my phd is in theoretical physics i write and
perform music (jazz playing trumpet and sometimes keyboards). i've
even had an original composition played on several jazz radio
stations around the world. cool! :-) i struggle to understand
life's big picture so have a kind of philosophical cast to the way
i approach things and a rather spiritual interest in what the heck
the universe is doing here. i mean .. what's with that!?<br />
<br />
i have other talents and interests so tend to enjoy meeting
people learning about them and in conversation enjoy sussing out
the details of their work and what intrigues them.<br />
<br />
i have a slightly quirky sense of humor.<br />
<br />
i'd like to meet an attractive woman who is intelligent educated
with talents of her own. she is trying to figure out a way to be a
valuable presence in the universe.<br />
<br />
physically i try to take care of myself and look for someone who
does the same. i have a strong sensuous side: my fingertip wants to
slip across that smooth dark red manzanita branch surprisingly
cool even in summer. there is a particular scent to a redwood tree
on a dry hot day.<br />
<br />
i am fairly well described as a myers-briggs intp (most of you
have heard of that stuff but its meaning is only a google away).
the n is the only matching characteristic i care about and it is
my most dominate trait.<br />
<br />
a lot of you love love love to travel! well i kind of enjoy
travel but frankly am not manic about it. at a tropical beach i
like to snorkel then sit in the shade and read. or hike into a
sierra wilderness lake for a day and write in a notebook there for
a few hours. i would prefer to visit my friends or relatives in a
distant country and experience the culture from within rather than
tear through on a bus or something.<br />
<br />
here are example conversation fragments that i would want a friend
to enjoy to contribute to to ask questions about or be tickled
by:<br />
<br />
o a theory of family dynamics: we each grow up in a family in which
spaces of activity and expertise are occupied by other family
members. it could be an older sister who plays the piano. a father
who is a sculptor. how does this influence how you develop?<br />
<br />
o a theory of humor: what makes one set of statements funny? one
model is there is a sudden frame of reference shift. maybe it can
be better in telling a joke to make that shift as rapid as
possible. let's tell some jokes and see if we can explain the
humor as a frame of reference shift! let's see if we can ruin the
funniness by retelling the joke so as to slow down the shift. let's
discuss other theories of what makes something funny with
examples.<br />
<br />
o an idle observation: wondering if the plane of the galaxy is
lined up with the plane of the orbiting planets. it might make
sense given the solar system formed from a swirling disk of gas as
part of the galaxy itself. let's go outside and look at the planets
and at the milky way and see how much they line up!<br />
<br />
ideally you should be curious and lean forward in conversations
that tickle your brain! :-)<br />

"lots of sob stories on this site but i'm pretty sure i'm not one
of them. basically with friends settling down and work commanding
an ever larger chunk of my time i'm just short on opportunities to
meet people these days. so let's give the online thing a
try...because attempting to describe yourself in writing is always
so much fun.<br />
<br />
at the most basic level just about everything i do is driven by my
curiosity about the people and world around me. i want see more
live more be more. hmmm...that probably sounds a little more
after-school-special-ish than i intended. to clarify experiencing
""more"" is just as likely to mean a sleepless 48 hour trip to vegas
as it is attending an astronomy lecture at the academy of sciences.
not that my interests know no bounds (for instance i'd rather bite
my thumbs off than sit through an opera and i will never
understand the allure of a fashion show) but i'm generally up for
anything new. that said the activities that i enjoy most include
writing in any form travelling somewhere warm playing sports and
finding more obscure bands to add to my oddly diverse music
library. i've worked hard to carve out a great career for myself
but that just means i play twice as hard when the time comes.<br />

what am i looking for? if only i knew. i can tell you what i can't
do without: light-heartedness and a genuine nature. sound cliche?
good. who doesn't enjoy a good laugh with a sincere person? aaaaand
now that we've weeded out all of you women who hate to laugh how
about being a bit more specific? well i definitely don't have a
type past relationships have not shared many similarities. i'm
attracted to confidence especially when paired with the same
easy-going inquisitive disposition that i feel i possess. as an
outgoing person i enjoy the same quality in others no matter the
circumstance. and while we're telling the truth it's important to
me to maintain a good amount of physical activity in my life and i
would probably make the best match with someone who has some
interest in regular exercise be it team
sports/swimming/hiking/sumo wrestling/caber toss/whatever - i just
enjoy being active. aside from that please pack an open mind

slopes at north star homewood or alpine by day and making new

on this little site for a bit i've been snooping<br />
and decided to dedicate this rhyme to you okcupid<br />
firsly i must confess here with absolute candor<br />
i do not mean to dish out sacrilege or slander<br />
would like to avoid at all costs being abusive or rude<br />
cause i believe this site is at least somewhat cute...<br />
but i did almost fall over when starting to laugh<br />
there're enough essays here to write a book and a half!<br />
c'mon ladies take a very good look at yourselves<br />
would one rather date or fill out forms like an a$$?<br />
don't know about you but i have one tiny contention<br />
filing out questionnaires is not my intention<br />
been proven answer-matching dating is largely a scam<br />
since when did love and romance become an exam?<br />
might be tough for people to connect and converge<br />
if there is no old-fashioned simple and quick search<br />
so while you're busy determining your category and type<br />
please love yourself and don't trust the hype! ;)<br />
<br />
i am romantic kind-hearted and honest<br />

<br />
i have a habit of counting exact change when paying cashiers. i
love to start new personal projects but usually don't end up
finishing them. i love driving around sometimes and just looking at
homes. don't know much anything architecture but love looking at
them none the less. i toggle between overeating and working out a
bunch. i enjoy going to the gym yoga krav maga being with
friends board game nights making beer and sunday brunch with the
family. some week nights i enjoy switching channels between msnbc
and fox news. sometimes i switch back and forth every 5
minutes.<br />
<br />
i've played different roles at my job. in the end i think it's of
little importance what i do for a living. who i do it with though
is critical. i love my coworkers free food in the kitchen plane
trips and dinners to work and schmooze with counterparties
planning meetings with my team around this or that and solving
problems in excel. also office politics there is a drag only once
a year during bonus and promotion season. sometimes i work in
spreadsheets so long i lose all ability to socialize. i can't tell
jokes laugh or crywell usually i can still cry. those are the
nights when i watch msnbc and fox news. in short i've been at my
current job for seven years now and still love it.<br />
<br />
i get excited about cooking but usually don't have energy for it
and eat out a lot. i'm usually a vegetarian a paleo dieter a junk
food eater or am living solely off of lemon juice maple syrup and
cayenne pepper for 10 days straight. i'm very strict about only
doing one at a time however.<br />
<br />
how about you? do you know what you want to be when you grow up? do
you always stick to what you set out to do and never back down to
anything in your way? have you cured yourself of all eccentric
habits only weird people do? are you........ efficient? if so then
i wish you the best of luck finding your dream guy.<br />
<br />
do you love your body and celebrate it both through indulgence and
with a healthy living? do you enjoy being lazy but tirade yourself
when you do it in excess? does my profile sing to you? if so maybe
you and i should get to know each other for real.<br />
<br />
hopefully by the time you're reading this i've already felt the
same way about you and sent you email. if you're making the first
move don't fret. maybe i already saw your profile and was moved.
maybe i'm just being a jerk thinking i have something more
important to do than send you an email tonight. it can happen
because it takes me a long time to write one of these emails.

"ok here's the deal. i'm just going to put all my cards on the
table to make things easier for both of us.<br />
<br />
i pretty much have my life dialed in. i'm a tenured university
professor and absolutely love what i do. my research and
interaction with students is rewarding and incredibly fulfilling
for me. i adore living in san francisco and own my own home
surrounded by a billion great restaurants.<br />
<br />
part of the reason i became a professor is because i burned out in
an internet startup back in the late 90s.<br />
<br />
i'm most attracted to women that really crack me up. big big brains
are awesome too.<br />
<br />
i'm a funny guy but my sense of humor is often twisted and
irreverent leaving many to wonder how such weird thoughts can come
out of such a normal looking guy.<br />
<br />
i played organized sports all the time when i was younger but i
don't like watching sports. super bowl parties aren't my thing for
example.<br />
<br />
i love having a drink with friends at a restaurant or wine bar but
i don't hang out in bars.<br />
<br />
i love eating at restaurants and eat just about every cuisine but
i'm very particular about my food. i've tried lots of weird things
to eat around the world but you won't find me eating organs at
incanto.<br />
<br />
i navigate life's major events and circumstances with poise and
strength but the little things can drive me nuts. as in ""ugh.
they put catchup on my burger again.""<br />
<br />
cooking is something i really enjoy but never do for just myself. i
do some stuff well but not everything. trained by a native thai to
make a mean curry. learned to cook meat make pan-sauces with a
chez panisse chef; got schooled by a maverick chef (e.g. ask me
about grand marnier french toast!).<br />
<br />
i'm about people not about doing things per se. when i wake up on
a saturday morning i think about *who* i'm going to call not
*what* i'm going to do.<br />
<br />
i'm socially liberal but fiscally conservative. noncriminal stuff
should be legal as long as it doesn't get out of hand. the
government should have no control over people's bodies nor say who
can get married. i'm all for a strong defense but spending $700b
per year is ridiculous. i'm not a good match for someone who is too
conservative or too liberal.<br />
<br />
i play a pretty mean piano (boogie blues). i try but i suck at
singing despite lots of lessons. i rarely go to hear live music
but when i do it's usually at a cafe or a street band (i.e. not
deafening).<br />
<br />
i fully appreciate that we don't completely understand the world
around us and the universe but i view most things through the lens
of the scientific method. i'm not a good match for someone that
considers horoscopes psychics and the like as more than
entertainment. i'm not a good match for someone into crystals
chakras energy healing etc...<br />
<br />
i have lived in france and have traveled extensively throughout the
world but i love america (sf in particular) and doubt i could live
in another country. maybe australia mate.<br />

i was my dad's caretaker for 10 years before he died.<br />
<br />
i'm trained to call when i say i will. my 2 sisters have groomed me
(btw they are expecting kickbacks).<br />
<br />
i swim 2-3x / week and like to do citywalks or moderate hikes.
though i grew up backpacking/camping all over co/ut/nm i'm not
into that anymore.<br />

i'm fairly politically incorrect but never racist or
misogynistic.<br />

i love spontaneity but i take a very long view and plan my life
strategically.",150000

i still enjoy meeting new people who may prove to be amazing and
special and not in a short bus kind of way. i'm deeper than a

should also say that i'm not into pursuing a romance here but
honest friendships are always ok. i personally feel it disingenuous

editor's note - i<br />
because someone actually did put in the effort (like a champ!)
toward something more i can't say that i'm entirely single by
definition... which is really nice. :) there's not much hiding

believe children should be taught to be cautious of strangers and
adults should be taught just the opposite.<br />

i'm equally comfortable in a business suit or a bunny suit. if you
do it do it with some passion.<br />

whenever i'm at a bookstore i head straight to the back and check
out the black &amp; white photography books and the books about zen
gardens. then i look at every other book in the store.<br />

i believe we should all wear capes all the time. not really but i
like the idea. seems like it would solve issues for people with low
self esteem if nothing else.<br />
<br />
i believe you reap what you sow. what comes around goes around.
karma. ish.<br />
<br />
prefer people who are for things over people who are against
things. like curious people and clever bastards. love sarcasm but
not cynics.<br />

when i was younger i decided that when i got married the wedding
would be in the greek isles. now i'm a bit older i get that i have
no say in that. but still.<br />

eventually landed in sf. bit of a chameleon happy in the mission
happy in the marina happy watching a game with friends or at an
art opening.<br />
<br />
very close with my family and have some wildly entertaining
friends. even if you don't want to date me we should hang out
you'd have fun. over the years my dad has tought me how to fix
lots of stuff which is nice -- someone recently looked at me with
that ""how do you know how to do that?"" look that i am always giving
my dad. it occurs to me just now that i must look perpetually
clueless and shocked to my dad. my mom is a rockstar. she's sold on
the whole god program so we don't see eye-to-eye on religion but
that's fine still love her to bits. (althought lately i've been
wondering if there's not something to the whole ""praying"" thing --
not that there's a guy in a cloud granting wishes but maybe it
focuses me/you/people/stuff/energy on a particular problem. not
sure.) have two very cool brothers a matching pair of sis-in-laws
and 3 super cute niece/nephews.<br />

i'm super sarcastic and find that trait entertaining in others but
worry my humor doesn't translate over email so i'd rather just meet
up.<br />

i've got a cool job and have been successful at what i do becuase
i'm passionate about it but i don't take myself (or life in
general) too seriously.<br />

like 100% of the people on this site i like to travel and will
happily go anywhere on little to no notice. when i was young i met
a swedish girl while traveling in south america who's grandmother
had given her an apartment in her will. she immediately rented it
out and had been traveling on the rent payments for over a year. i
immediately fell in love with that idea and have since been slowly
buying up all of the properties on the planet so i can do
that.<br />
<br />
i'm not a flake. i do what i say i'm going to do. i follow through.
my friends have gotten used to this and it makes them nervous
because not all of my ideas are good. they also can't figure out
why i am single. i think i'm single beacuse i work hard and play
hard and haven't been too focused on meeting the right someone;
trying to work on that.",150000

york city. been back in sf for about 6 months now.<br />

another thing i don't have any picture of me smiling here because
i had braces for second time for 2.5 years. now that i am without
them i will probably get some pictures with smiling. in reality i
do smile and laugh a lot.<br />

continue to enjoy life and have as much fun as i can. i'm highly
sarcastic which can rub some people the wrong way. i'm young enough

get enough sushi and like my steak medium rare. i prefer cats over
dogs. i like talking about the big issues that matter in life just
as much as those trivial matters that don't matter at all but are
just too funny to ignore (think george carlin) i can't dance but
delusional enough to think i can fake it better than most guys!

therefore the best description i can possibly give is provided by
a friend:<br />
<br />
""kofi is an intelligent guy who is open-minded level-headed and
down-to-earth with a fun sense of humor. you can put him in a room
with most anyone and he can get along with them. in addition he is
understanding and empathetic key traits women typically find
lacking in most men. he is also patient. for instance i promised
him this testimonial weeks ago and he didn't even harass me just
gently prodded. haha. ""<br />
<br />
what i am looking for<br />
<br />
i am truly grateful for all the amazing intricacies life has to
offer. and you the person that i am looking for should be as
well. you understand that life can have tons of twists and turns
and sometimes you need to roll with the punches. you are
non-judgmental of others and believe in the phrase ""live and let
live"" as long as you're not hurting someone.<br />
<br />
humor is subjective. and being compatible in that area is
incredibly important in a relationship. my humor is pretty crass.
if you like family guy and south park we'll probably get along. if
you don't ... you will probably find me un-funny.<br />
<br />
we all need to laugh at ourselves and each other. it's not what we
say that matters but how we say it and the intent with which we
say it. i strive to understand our differences appreciate them
accept them and laugh about them. and you should too.",150000
"the first things that come to mind?<br />
* i'd much rather be outdoors than in.<br />
* with that said art galleries live music of all sorts or a trip
to a museum all sound good to me.<br />
* i like to have a drink but rarely rarely go out with the intent
of getting hammered.<br />
* i think i'm pretty normal but i'm probably more introspective
than most.<br />
<br />
what do i want?<br />
i want to care about someone more than i care about myself.<br />
i want a partner in crime with whom i can explore the world with
while still enjoying all the little things right in front of our
noses.<br />
i want to f*ck like rabbits every time with as much excitement as
the first.<br />
i want to completely drop my guard expose all my quirks and be as
goofy as i want without being judged.<br />
i want to get excited whenever the phone rings.<br />
i want to constantly be thinking of little gift ideas just so i
can see you smile.<br />
i want to be challenged to be pushed to do more with my life and
to be a better man.<br />
i want someone in my life that i can brag about without
hesitation.<br />
i want to look at someone in awe incredulous that such an amazing
person might actually feel the same way about me.",150000
"the questions are definitely easier than writing about myself. how
bout this...i'm well traveled but not well read. i've had enough
jobs and enough schooling to know what i'm really good and really
like doing. i'm old enough to finally be mature (takes much longer
for a man and much longer than i thought i needed) and young
enough to know that you've got to go out and do stuff to have
fun.<br />
<br />
i want to be spending time with a strong woman who knows what she
wants and knows she deserves it. i think that takes a more mature
woman as well...especially the second part.",150000
"these summaries are tough: here let me boil myself down to 3
paragraphs or less so you hopefully don't get bored.<br />
<br />
it's time to hit the reset button on certain parts of my life. i've
spent the last 10 years trying to accomplish a lot of things with
my education my career my relationships--basically everything i
thought i needed to be a complete person but i was really getting
narrow. the plan now is to keep what works and work on the rest. a
big part of that for me is meeting a girl who helps things click
into place.<br />
<br />
i'm more-or-less a bay area native but spent the years between
1998-2010 living in la and then dc. since i've been back i've been
doing a horrible job of re-exploring the area and an even worse
job of reconnecting with old friends or finding new ones. i love
sports (playing and watching). i really like my job but i'd rather
go back to the office after managing the office softball team than
miss the game.<br />
<br />
on the whole i dig my life--but i still need to enjoy it a little
more than i have been. i've decided to stop letting things i really
like slip by - things like camping hiking going to ball games and
concerts and just generally exploring the cool stuff to do where i
live.",150000
"they searched me thoroughly in paris.<br />
take out liquids. electronics. valuables.<br />
empty your pockets! put all power supplies<br />

<br />
yes they searched me thoroughly<br />
those parisians.<br />
yet they couldn't find you<br />
---<br />
the poem says some things about me: i have spent far too long in
airports. i have travelled partly for work to about 40 countries
and i love it. bhutan. senegal. ethiopia. all over europe. also i
like words art music and poetry. and i have a tendency for
occasional sudden romanticism.<br />
<br />
i grew up in india moved to the netherlands to work at a
university research group and got used to colleagues calling me
professor which was odd as i'd dropped out of middle school.
dutch social liberalism suited me and i became a citizen; i'm sort
of proud that the world's first legal gay wedding was blessed by
the dutch queen. my work resulted in a crazy worldwide travel
schedule mostly to speak at large conferences.<br />
<br />
i co-founded an internet start-up in san francisco with an old
friend from india and after we got funded moved to california
last year. i travel much less now and i miss it; i do go back to
brussels every couple of months for the part-time university
position &amp; apartment i still have there surrounded by the
world's best chocolates &amp; beer.",150000
"things i like<br />
- dinner with a small group of friends eating something
delicious<br />
- staying up late<br />
- winning (preferably at settlers of catan)<br />
- making people smile<br />
- coffee<br />
<br />
tu ne cede malis sed contra audentior ito",150000
"think of me as a sort of community organizer or program manager
bringing together men elves dwarves and halflings to work toward
common goals.",150000
"this is a pretty good read. admittedly windy. scanning for key
words and tone will work. let me know what you think. and good
luck.<br />
<br />
i seek a kind funny soulful athletic intellect (maybe not quite
""ual""). i love sports literature music (all kinds including
classical and hard core rap) discussing current social and
political issues and ongoing social and psychological topics and
talking about good old business (mine happens to be online
retail).<br />
<br />
because i enjoy harmless opptys to be a contrarian i still use pop
to mean a soft drink. i recently read a great article about
hipsters and what makes them so. it's the short term satisfaction
of an early lead; once other folks claim a similar affinity the
hipsters are on to something else. i get that but at the ripe old
age of 41 find that its as enjoyable to hang on to interests and
tastes past their popularity. skinnies once flare leg is in. old
school lingo that isnt cool anymore.<br />
<br />
i am a business woman with an mba and a seriously normal life. but
i have more of an edge than the measurable characteristics suggest.
maybe a lot of people feel that way? i am not only a typical
indiana born uva educated mba holding business person. i like
the countercurrent. i identify with the angst of punk rock. i would
hate to be thought of as self-satisfied.<br />
<br />
i love both the peacefulness and the unfckingbelievelable terror of
the ocean. the beauty and the breadth of a big sky (seattle new
zealand- do you know the skies i mean?) can both bring me great joy
and can make me feel tremendous (brief) loneliness.. i am afraid of
many things which i hope given how i live my life makes me
courageous. in contrast to many of my friends i am not all that
surprised that i am still single. i am looking for someone and a
dynnamic that is exceptional. absent it i am fine alone.<br />
<br />
a bit more about me if youre the type of person who is inclined to
actually read on --<br />
i love music but if i had to choose between never hearing again or
never seeing again i'd choose the former. i'm a hoosier by birth
but traveled growing up and have lived several nifty places as an
adult domestically and abroad so appreciate and respect many
different ways of living. i love brussel sprouts. i am
appreciative. i have loved and appreciated old people since i was a
very little girl. i'm funny. ""knock knock...""<br />
<br />
i love being on in and around water. i enjoy cooking but am not
great at following recipes. i am a direct but sensitive
communicator who doesn't shy away from tough topics. i appreciate
sweetness in men. i read several books a month and am currently
reading about 1/2 fiction and 1/2 neuroscience related non. i
notice a lot. i love mary oliver's poetry. in heavy rotation on my
ipod right now are the national the editors less popular rolling
stones (like ""heaven"") bon iver pete yorn muse and here we go
rabbit. i'm a violinist but don't practice enough these days. i
like rap and 80s punk too.<br />
<br />
fewer i more you and we-- i like quirkiness and playful irreverence
(so do you). you will watch tv shows with me after they are out on
hulu or itunes. you like that i'm loyal and have a wonderful family
including parents who have been happily married for 51 years. we
are both grateful that we were raised to want to be both happy and
productive. we're both smart. and quick. we can't imagine being
with a partner who didnt make us laugh. i swim (slowly these days)
and run (decently quick at middle distance); we workout together.
we enjoy being alone together reading side by side on a couch. we
love hiking running water skiing and going on boat rides up at
the lake.<br />
<br />
lastly we share a curiosity and engagement in the world that keeps
us connected even when schedules and life in general challenge our
time together. this is what i think has been at the root of my
parents' successful marriage.<br />

"this is my secondary profile. i'm a techie. this is the profile

"this is one of the most difficult things to do. to say who we are
on a screen using only words. no expression no gestures no
intense engagement not a sense of energy of chemistry. and to be
honest i feel that most people base everything on the things that
ultimately don't matter. (my opinion and some statistics
haha)<br />
i am someone who strives to be the best i can be in whatever i do.
i love to learn to evolve to share to care to laugh and i am
looking for someone similar. i expect there to be differences but
not necessarily in basic values and goals. my goal if i can call
it that is to be with someone that wants to make a difference in
this world not just her own little world. to create something
together. it's not about me or her but about we and us. i am not
conventional in my thinking. i think and feel outside the box and
even though i don't always succeed i continue to be aware and try
to learn from my mistakes. my partner would be someone who speaks
her mind who has something to say can say it with feeling and
conviction. i promise i will listen. someone who can communicate
her innermost feelings desires and wants. i am quite comfortable
socially and i like to explore different venues whether that
means trying new foods new activities new ways of thinking or
just simply being open. i am aware of my imperfections but i don't
see them as such. they are just opportunities to better who i am. i
do not need to be in a relationship i choose to be in a
relationship. i am not looking for someone who finds their
happiness in external things. for ex. money material things a
provider etc.. i do feel in a lot of ways it's not possible to be
happy with someone else unless we are happy with who we are. so
in other words it's all about putting in our best effort to create
a space of happiness love  care peace passion for our partners
not only thinking about our egos.<br />
i will continue to elaborate on this section but i will end in
saying that life can be long but it can also be short. we really
really really never know when we are finished with the body that
is currently on loan. so in searching for truth and striving to be
""real"" i hope you will do the same.<br />
just in ending: first of all if you haven't read this far i guess
it doesn't matter lol  but if you're reading this. and there's a
basic decent honest human to human connection? meaning a simple
response would be very much appreciated. if you're interested
great---if you're not great just the same. what's due to me will
come to me so if it's not meant to be it's not meant to be.

way.<br />
you are well read and joy swims in the air around you; you can't
help that either.<br />
you are a doer more than a watcher and creator more than
consumer.<br />
you are fit slim (please!) and are strong in both the obvious and
secret ways.<br />

in my ideal relationship which i envision in our future we wake
up and our lips are touching before our eyes open. then later we
are walking along the california coast waves splashing against the
mossy rocks the salty spray touching our faces.<br />
we sit arm in arm for an hour not having to talk just soaking in
the beauty.<br />

twin peaks shortly after dawn on saturday mornings; sipping a

spots; dining at small intimate restaurants and on occasion
cruising back roads on sunny weekend afternoons with a mysterious
passenger by his side.<br />
our foreign correspondents have verified that he owns a valid
passport with dozens of stamps and have also spotted him scuba
diving at various tropical locales as well as dining at out-of-the
way bistros in the south of france.<br />
some say he attends local charity functions on a regular basis and
has been known to organize large social groups for fun and

"well i just moved to sf from the east coast. this is just an
interesting new medium to meet people and i'm hoping to find
someone adventurous to join in on exploring my new coast.<br />
<br />
i think life is truly too short to not squeeze in as many
interesting stories situations and people as possible. so that
usually calls for random flights and road trips to places. some
exotic (thailand the philippines spain england). some less
exotic but still fun (nebraska...seriously...). i grew up all over
the place so i wouldn't say that i particularly have a
favorite...but i do love trying new things and meeting new people
and living some pretty crazy stories.<br />
<br />
i'm always trying to learn something new so this summer i decided
i will do three things: 1) get my helmsman status for sailing 2)
dive and sail the greek islands (travel is cheap when you're flying
into molotov cocktails and rubber bullets) and 3) host an
authentic crawfish boil at my apartment (i have a nice outdoor area
in the city and am always trying to bring some louisiana to you
folk).",150000

"well i've been living here in sf since august '11. i hail from
seattle -- 20 years! it was a pretty big move for me because i
don't know a lot of people here in town and it came with a brand
new job which i'm loving so far.<br />
<br />
i believe this move marks the beginning of my ""rockstar"" chapter
and i'm here to enjoy it!<br />
<br />
i'm the product of a 1960's hippie and 3 tour vietnam helicopter
pilot which i think has afforded me good perspective on just how
different two people can be and still make it work for a time
anyway. for them 20 years. plenty of fodder for the shrink and
i've done my time on the couch.<br />
<br />
i am painfully honest but i am never hurtful or vicious or mean.
i'm not a fighter but i'm not afraid to heat up a conversation
when it's necessary. that said i'm not above pinning you down and
making you smell my armpit. i don't follow rules well or read the
instructions. i get pulled over by the cops a couple times a year
for traffic violations. still i'm responsible physically fit

i'm up for fun adventure and passion - in that order.",150000
"well my friends say i'm clever bright honest and funny brave
and fiercely loyal to those close to me. i enjoy the company of
intelligent and thoughtful people and like a good conversation. i
can be opinionated about the things i'm passionate about but when
i'm wrong i am quick to admit it.<br />
<br />
despite being shy i have a thousand stories to tell so yeah i
can be a bit talkative (but hopefully in a positive and
entertaining way) and a little bit cheeky too (but it's usually
just nerves).<br />
<br />
i'm not super-ambitious but i do have a strong work ethic and
believe that whatever it is we set out to do in life (and that goes
for work interests sports or hobbies) it says a lot about your
character. so if you're passionate about what it is that you focus
on and believe it is important then that's terrific because i'd
like to be able to share that with you. if however you're happy
just to amble along in life with no particular direction or goal
or if you hate or are bored with your job and cannot be bothered to
take charge and do anything about it then i'm guessing we probably
won't get along.<br />
<br />
i tend to gravitate towards more serious or shy types so your dry
humor and quiet confidence will always win out over brash
gregarious extroverts anytime. and if you are shy i promise i'll
do a lot of the talking until you warm up ;)<br />
<br />
i enjoy learning new things and find happiness in accomplishment
be it at work or in my hobby pursuits. i am equally technical and
creative artist geek and nerd.<br />
<br />
i'm pretty much a city girl enjoying the hustle and bustle dining
out or having coffee but not much into nightclubs or crowded
parties. being a geek my ideal outing would be visiting the
exploratorium or the tech museum in san jose (such a cool place - i
wish i was 10 again ;))<br />
<br />
deal breakers? i don't generally wear makeup and prefer to dress
sensibly for the weather. by choice i don't own a car and try to
walk or cycle where ever it is that i need to go.<br />

<br />
a guide to talking to women in bars and other things<br />
<br />
before we begin let's consider two basic points about women's (a)
needs and (b) communication styles.<br />
<br />
first (a) women's needs:<br />
<br />
 women need security and women need to feel attractive. they need
it like men need approval. no psychobabble it's just true.<br />
<br />
secondly (b) women's communication styles:<br />
<br />
 men communicate by demonstrating their accomplishments. this
demonstrates their prowess and garners approval. listen to men
talk: sports stats their knowledge of movies music politics
their possessions i did this i did that etc.<br />
<br />
 women communicate to establish intimacy. i'm not sure why cause
i'm not a woman but it's true. listen to them talk. they give all
these details that seem so irrelevant. this is what i was
wearing and then janine said... and every guy wants to yell
get to the fuckin' point!! however these details are not
irrelevant to them. they are attempting to establish intimacy. so
listen or at least look like you're listening. it's not important
to a woman that her story is important to you. it's important that
she feels like you know it's important to her.<br />
<br />
please remember these two points: (a) women need security and they
need to feel attractive and (b) they communicate to establish
intimacy. this is as much a part of women as a strong pitching
staff is to the new york yankees. curb your own communication style
toward these two points and you will prosper. ignore these two
points at your own risk.<br />
<br />
okay let's begin.<br />
<br />
first off don't use lines. can i buy you a drink? do you have
the time? are those space-pants? cause your ass is out of this
world! lines are stupid. you're a stud you don't need
lines.<br />
<br />
be yourself. if you are a loud funny crazy guy go with that. if
you are shy and quiet go with that. the more comfortable you are
the better off you are.<br />
<br />
now go to the bar with a group of friends. you have strength and
numbers you show that you have a life plus you need to take a
wingman if you're going to talk to a woman who is not alone.<br />
<br />
now when you see the girl of choice try to make a little eye
contact if you can. she's already noticed every guy in the place
just like you've noticed every cute girl. don't stand by staring
and drooling if you she doesn't notice you after a short while
(about the amount of time it takes you to slowly and calmly finish
your drink) go over to her.<br />
<br />
now before you do you must say these words to yourself and you
must believe them 100%. i don't need this woman and if i get shot
down so what she probably has crabs.<br />
<br />
try it now just to yourself (make sure your co-workers/roommates
aren't watching) i don't need this women and if i get shot down
so what she probably has crabs.<br />
<br />
try it again i don't need this women and if i get shot down so
what she probably has crabs.<br />
<br />
and believe it. whether or not some chick in a bar likes you is
meaningless. if she rejects you it is completely inconsequential
in the grand scheme of your life. you're a stud trust me.<br />
<br />
now walk up to her and say hi. i'm insert your name.' (shake
her hand firmly but don't be brutish; you probably outweigh her by
fifty pounds). either she will say so. or she will say hi i'm
insert her name.' if she says so or anything comparable shrug
and walk away. she probably has crabs.<br />
<br />
okay so she tells you her name. now what? if she has a boring name
(e.g. jen maria karen) don't say wow what a great name! but
if her name is exotic (margarita ezmerelda charlie) give her a
very laid back comment. great name or that's pretty. don't
gush. every other guy gushes. just a simple compliment will
do.<br />
<br />
if she has crazy hair or shiny blue eyes or some feature that looks
like every guy has commented on it don't say anything. please. if
all goes well you'll have plenty of time to compliment them
another time.<br />
<br />
now say ezmerelda how are you doing tonight? sounds simple
right? it is.<br />
<br />
are you having a good night? if she says no say oh that's
too bad i hope your night gets better. it was nice meeting you.
cheers. leave. you do not need to get mixed up with someone like
that. she either wants to be left alone or she's looking for pity.
you don't need any pity cases especially pity cases with crabs.
(no she doesn't have actual crabs. it's a metaphor and if you
haven't figured that out by now then you probably have crabs.)
:-)<br />
<br />
if she says yes then you're in<br />
<br />
here's how simple it is. here's how you talk to women right here
right now...<br />
<br />
you say great. me too. my buddies and i are just kicking back
after a great day of ____________.<br />
<br />
(of course you actually need to do something with your life.) (if
all you do is play video games or watch movies or wrestle your
monkey you're fucked. you need more help then i can give.)<br />
<br />
so what do you do with your life stud? if you do outdoor stuff
say after a great day of hiking. do you go to the beach? after
a great day at the beach. hell did you go out for lunch? say
after a great laid back saturday. the idea is that you did
something. and whatever you did it was great. you are someone who
enjoys life you are setting the stage for intimacy and you are
offering an emotion: enjoyment.<br />
<br />
now here's the catch she already knows whether you've got a shot.
if you've gotten this far she will either respond one of two ways.
she will either respond with enthusiasm or she will not.<br />
<br />
if she responds with enthusiasm (i.e. by asking questions)
describe your day with the same degree of enthusiasm. if she is
psyched you be psyched. if she is mellow you be mellow. then
before you exhaust the topic you switch gears. you ask her how her
weekend day whatever is going. if she volunteers the info
great she's talking and beginning her own establishment of
intimacy. and as we all know that's what she needs.<br />
<br />
(if she is not enthusiastic or interested then she is not
interested. at this point say well it was nice to meet you
excuse yourself walk away she probably has crabs etc.)<br />
<br />
i know it sounds trite but what i really dislike about some people
(not just women) is when they fail to ask questions and just talk
about themselves.<br />
<br />
keep her talking ask her question and after question after
question. don't talk about yourself. nothing is as boring to a
woman as you. if she wants to know about you she will ask. the
only time you talk besides asking the questions is to relate a
comparable story. but at this point you direct the conversation by
asking her questions and letting her establish intimacy.<br />
<br />
if the conversation starts to stagnate here are some basic
questions to remember?<br />
<br />
1. what kind of music do you like? a favorite artist/group?<br />
2. are you from this area originally?<br />
3. what kind of movies are you into? a favorite kind of movie?
favorite movie?<br />
4. what do you do for a living?<br />
5. hobbies?<br />
6. family?<br />
7. do you travel? where would you go if you could?*<br />
<br />
*(number 7 is especially good. all women love travel and all women
love fantasy. where would you go? is super. of course don't use
number 7 right away. build up to it and then bang!)<br />
<br />
now you have to close the deal. when it feels right say let's
get together some time. don't ask her. tell her. it's more
natural. and she will like the confidence. if she especially liked
you opener ask her if she would like to join you the next time
you're going to do it. or just ask her out to dinner. or a night on
the town or the theatre or jesus anything you and she would enjoy
together.<br />
<br />
(don't suggest anything for a first date that you don't want to do.
the ballet will most likely bore the pants off of you. you'll get
irritated you'll get anxious and your first date will be your
last. go to the park or have a picnic or something mutually
enjoyable.)<br />
<br />
great let me have your phone number and i'll give you a call.
that's it. you're done. now if you say you are going to call then
call. women hate liars like every other team hates the world
champion new york yankees.<br />
<br />
so to recap:<br />
<br />
1. be yourself.<br />
2. hi<br />
3. how are you?<br />
4. great i (me and my buddies) are just kicking back after a
great day of<br />
5. questions questions questions<br />
6. let's get together<br />
<br />
and remember those seventeen magic words ""i don't need this woman
and if i get shot down so what she probably has crabs.""<br />
<br />
so there you go. that's how you talk to women. good luck.<br />
<br />
p.s. to all you women reading this i know there will be some stop
with the fucking expectations and self-deprecation in you
ads.<br />
<br />
1. if love is gonna happen it will happen. you can't force it no
matter how loud your biological clock is ticking. meet the guy.
talk to him. see what happens.<br />
<br />
2. fat chick looking for love so what i'm not a supermodel.
i'm not into casual sex or any sex or ahhhh!!!! calm down girl.
you are not as ugly as you think you are. in fact whether you are
overweight or not i'm sure you're probably a lot cuter than you
think you are. if stats are an issue for you don't put it in your
ad. the reason men are not responding is not because you are in
your own words fat its cause you sound like you hate yourself.
nobody man or women wants to be around a negative person. it's
okay. you are okay. really.<br />
<br />
p.s.s. while i'm ranting women men do not expect you to look like
supermodels!!! we think it would be nice if you did but we don't
expect it. when a man is alone with a woman she is beautiful. she
is there. she is real. she smells and tastes and sounds real. and
that is beautiful.<br />
<br />
god bless you crazy people.<br />
<br />
maybe we're supposed to meet the wrong people before meeting the
right one so that when we finally meet the right person we will
know how to be grateful for that gift.<br />
<br />
maybe when the door of happiness closes another opens but often
times we look so long at the closed door that we don't see the one
which has been opened for us.<br />
<br />
maybe the best kind of friend is the kind you can sit on a porch
and swing with never say a word and then walk away feeling like
it was the best conversation you've ever had. men can have a
complete conversation and have it be a total of five words in as
many hours.<br />
<br />
maybe it is true that we don't know what we have got until we lose
it but it is also true that we don't know what we have been missing
until it arrives.<br />
<br />
giving someone all your love is never an assurance that they will
love you back. don't expect love in return; just wait for it to
grow in their heart; but if it does not be content it grew in
yours.<br />
<br />
it takes only a minute to get a crush on someone an hour to like
someone and a day to love someone but it takes a lifetime to
forget someone.<br />
<br />
don't go for looks; they can deceive. don't go for wealth; even
that fades away. go for someone who makes you smile because it
takes only a smile to make a dark day seem bright. find the one
that makes your heart smile.<br />
<br />
there are moments in life when you miss someone so much that you
just want to pick them from your dreams and hug them for
real.<br />
<br />
dream what you want to dream; go where you want to go; be what you
want to be because you have only one life and one chance to do all
the things you want to do.<br />
<br />
always put yourself in others' shoes. if you feel that it hurts
you it probably hurts the other person too. the happiest of
people don't necessarily have the best of everything; they just
make the most of everything that comes along their way.<br />
<br />
happiness lies for those who cry those who hurt those who have
searched and those who have tried for only they can appreciate
the importance of people who have touched their lives.<br />
<br />
love begins with a smile grows with a kiss and ends with a tear.
the brightest future will always be based on a forgotten past you
can't go on well in life until you let go of your past failures and
heartaches.<br />
<br />
when you were born you were crying and everyone around you was
smiling. live your life so that when you die you are the one who
is smiling and everyone around you is crying.",150000

be forewarned i am bi-coastal: i live in between sf and nyc
though mostly sf these days. i'm in nyc about a week a month. if
you are looking for a serious stable monogamous relationship you
might want to look elsewhere. i am open to it but my traveling and
general workaholic nature makes it difficult. also i get bored
easily; i am looking for someone who is motivated to learn new
things and challenge themselves daily.<br />
<br />
too many interests and not enough time in the day. . .<br />
<br />
full text:<br />
i am highly motivated and ambitious and anything i do i strive to
do very very well. i'm somewhat of a polymath so whenever i travel
i am weighed down by books of all sorts and usually with my guitar.
i travel a lot so that generally just means i have a lot of crap in
my car.<br />
<br />
i like to keep my mind and body fit. i played division i squash in
college. bonus points if you are from the west coast and know what
squash is. i have a prodigious talent in racket sports and will
most likely kick your ass at tennis ping pong badminton etc. if
you can beat me at any of these sports definitely message
me.<br />
<br />
i'm in a band that sounds like the dirty projectors and bjork had a
lovechild. the music is challenging both technically and for the
listener but i am really excited about the project. we're
recording our first album now.<br />
<br />
one of my long term projects is a piece of performance art that
fuses interactive audio-visual environments theatre audience
participation and dance. it is an ambitious idea and will require
a lot of technical and artistic expertise. i want to blur the line
between parties and art and let the audience influence the
experience in a direct and nuanced way.<br />
<br />
i'm an academic at heart but i'm not truly a nerd. i am very
extroverted; i strive to surround myself with talented and
motivated people like myself. i love the random insights of
strangers. (i think one of the best conversations i ever had was on
a new york city subway at 2 am with someone i'll never see again).
i love to dance more for self expression than anything and if the
music inspires me i will go till i am soaked in sweat and cleansed
of all emotional baggage. oh another random fact i did ballet for
a year when i was a kid. apparently i was pretty good because i
was fritz in the nutcracker in a major production of it. i quit a
few weeks after because ballet class f)(_*&amp;g sucked! being the
only straight pubescent aged boy in my class was no fun.<br />
<br />
for the moment i have decided to forgo graduate school in physics
in pursuit of music and a few entrepreneurial ideas that i will not
detail here. i am very interested in food politics distribution
and agricultural issues relating to sustainability as well as
alternative energy generation.<br />
<br />
my academic interests are diverse. as an undergrad i published a
paper on stochastic differential equations; we worked out a way to
get to the moon using far less fuel than any previously known path.
pretty sick but unfortunately it was my genius professor's idea i
just worked out the math.<br />
<br />
i am also interested in biological physics and protein folding and
all the other dope shit that is currently being done in molecular
bio. honestly i am interested in most cutting edge science. in
that sense i am an utter nerd. i love to get to the heart of
problems; i have a physicist's distaste for imprecise and vague
language and superstition.<br />
<br />
i am a major foodie as a result of working in a few restaurants in
new york city which spoiled me beyond belief. fortunately sf has
the second best food in this country (sorry. . . nyc has better
food in my opinion) so i can tolerate living here pretty well ;
)<br />
<br />
i grew up in a family of classical musicians. (my mom is a cellist
and father is flutist). my father's family are all scientists and
md's though so i suppose the apple didn't far very far from the
tree as i am a basically half scientist and half musician. i need
lots of intellectual stimulation all the time or i feel
unfulfilled.",250000
"acting on the advice of a friend i'm trying a new approach to
self-summary. here goes:<br />
<br />
wherever i go i'm perceived as an outsider and perhaps as a
result i find stark contrasts and juxtaposition entertaining. it's
essential to my humor.<br />
<br />
a series of perceived contrasts:<br />
<br />
*feminist/alpha male<br />
*power-lifter/rock climber/endurance athlete<br />
*academic economist/jock<br />
*high school dropout/harvard faculty award winner in
economics<br />

romantic relationships<br />
*left-wing political expert and activist/professional money
manager<br />
*public service oriented/vp at a consulting firm<br />

i once asked about a dozen friends classmates and selected
co-workers to describe me in one word. all but one said ""intense"".
the lone dissenter said ""gentle"". both are i believe critical to
who i am.<br />
<br />
i say this because my experience on this and other dating sites has
led me to believe that i am often sought for particular
superlatives rather than who i am as a whole. while i am ok with
being fetishized for intellect or height or build on occasion i
would prefer to meet friends and lovers that are interested in more
than a slice of me. and let me clear while i enjoy interacting
romantically and physically with the opposite sex i want to be
able to be friends first. i'm new to the area and i'd prefer to
start some enduring friendships. it can be part of a relationship
of some kind but if you won't want to hang out unless i sleep with
you kindly move on. i don't have time for that.<br />

for a triathlon - taking good care of my darling dog getting used
to the bay area starting a business and trying to make and meet
new friends.<br />

"i believe in full disclosure so the bad news first...i'm hooked on
two things. the first: i'm addicted to fresh fruit from the farmers
market. it's become so bad that i can't stand the stuff from the
grocery store so i have to hit the market twice a week. the
second: i'm hooked on pandora. there's something about having new
music fed to me all the time that feeds the amateur musician in
me.<br />
<br />
ok now that the hard part is out of the way let me explain. when
it comes to the farmers market it really comes down to the fact
that i am goal and achievement oriented; right now i have been
losing weight by changing my diet so i am faster at tennis. good
fresh food helps!<br />
<br />
the music thing; i was an amateur musician more than 20 years ago.
i don't play much anymore but if i hear a song i like i come home
and knock off the riffs....so i still dabble. if you can sing or
play we'd have a lot of fun. don't worry though i'm not that
good anymore so i'm not looking for a partner to play gigs at
parties.<br />
<br />
ready for the good news? i've been to cooking school and will
dazzle you with my fresh-ingredient approach to meals. i also make
a mean risotto; if you promise to not share the secret i'll share
it with you. it's about being patient and i'm ok with standing

good.<br />

i will have to make a comment about this site and the woman on it.
i'm sure the guys are the same. no they are not. they are just
baiting their pof hooks to just land each and everyone of you
little fishies then throw you back so you can be all bitter at
those good guys that actually want to take you out and treat you
like a woman but now that your all demented and messed up in the
head from the last 5 guys who were gone by 3am and ate your kids
lunch and capri-suns. hey i'm with ya.. i would be pissed too..
these sites are like puppy mills of sex. the stories i have heard
is amazing... so again i would be pissed off at all guys too. now
if your one of those people girls or guys that read these profiles
and take the words like the scripture it self and make your
almighty decision based on them... well you might not want to
write to me. the type of people i am seeking to be around are
better than me mentally physical and financially. i guess just a
decathlon of abilities. most of you are like 10k runners. you are
very good at one thing and that is about it. sorry i am leaving
all that behind. i will be checking your decathlon resume over
drinks for sure if your going to be apart of this trojan horse why
a trojan horse... why not! it is different and fun. there i go
again explaining my self. the people i want to be around will not
ask why but awesome!!!! i""m quite sure if your still reading this
far into it you get it.... you understand that any relationship is
started off like life with one simple element... time will do the
rest. independent thinking strong self worth seeing that there is
no box no limits and its pretty much driving in the fog... the
point to all of this is simple. anyone that makes it in: life
home school work relationships (all of them) business becoming
rich famous happy etc etc etc... the one thing they all have
in common is... like most successful scientists they acted they
failed failed 9/10 times but it only takes the one time to get it
very right so the point is when you stop trying to make things
happen with all your thinking just do what you know what it is
that your suppose to do and it will happen. not what you think
others think your suppose to do. but truly what your suppose to do
in the raw form.<br />
<br />
now back to what i need from you. good person smart person driven
person fun person don't take yourself too serious will pick a
penny up if you see one will throw away trash even if it isnt'
yours. let me touch on the pof thing again. if you really feel that
you can make such a great life altering decision about someones
personalty who they are their values and morals along with and
most importantly if your a good fit then do not please do not write
or get back to me. we both know that i will destroy your little box
that you think inside of and you dont want that... remember you
have to go get a new lunch and capri sun... ill just be the straw
that breaks your will and your inner soul....<br />
no i will not trade ""emails"" because your not comfortable<br />
no i will not meet for coffee... that is so gay to even say or
do... ""coffee"" serious...<br />
no i will not tell you about myself because you can read my
profile then we can talk about the rest over time as we build our
start up company or over happy hour drinks.<br />
no no no no no<br />

different lifetimes all in this one and am at a contemplative place
where i am seeking to be met by someone with a similar level of
self reflection. i am a combination of peace/calm and fiery
determination. the fiery part comes from a life of working to
accomplish a certain amount of comfort and satisfaction that my
intellect has been put to good use. the peaceful part comes from
realizing that accomplishment is not all it's cracked up to be. a
deep personal connection with a mate is taking center stage not to
complete me but to share in the discovery of what's good and
satisfying and fun. the hard work of figuring out ""what its all
about alfie"" is done and it's time for doing what comes easy. i
want to share friends entertainment travel spirituality. i'm
sincere in seeking a refreshing relationship with a guy who is
caring sexy and passionate. i am a libra and love being in love. i

listen to music (i like to have something on all the time) gamble
(no really i'll bet you it's not an addiction) and watch movies.
but my favorite ""hobby"" if you can call it that is travel. i love

someone who is supportive and nurturing has a good sense of
herself and has her own opinions and ideas while retaining an open
mind and the ability to learn and grow; she is interested and able
to bring these qualities to a relationship. honesty and
communication are very important she can expect the same from me in
return. if you enjoy a good discussion (or some verbal repartee or
at least some silly comebacks :-) that's a big plus. i am a bit shy

"you being in my target demographic i have a short time to capture
your interest or i lose my sale!<br />
<br />
so let me tell you about myself quickly.<br />
i roll hard. i have a never die attitude and i make things happen.
i am a source of inspiration to those around me and i have had
many experiences in life that have taught me to be humble (or more
humble as it were). i am in great shape; i take good care of
myself by being physically outgoing and eating a balanced
diet.<br />
<br />
i spend my time doing what i want when i want which is a luxury i
have afforded myself. i have never had a job; i have always created
money for myself through different deals and investments.<br />
<br />
i am emotionally well adjusted; socially too for that matter. i
understand both my short comings and strengths emotionally but
overall feel i am rather well balanced. every year i look back and
am amazed at how much i have grown which is a trend i plan on
continuing. i work hard to be a true renaissance man ;)<br />
<br />
i am not a secret squirrel or creeeeeper and i have no
ex-girlfriends hiding in the bushes.<br />
<br />
i like being a man and i am looking for a woman. i am a protector
and take care of those close to me (it's us against the world). i
like to run the show in a general sense. i like women that smell
good and do girly things. given the effort i put into myself and my
body it is important for me that i be with someone that is height
weight proportionate and attractive. i tend to date women older
than me but i am always open to a new experience with someone
younger than me.<br />

"you might be wondering why my profile name is such that it is. well
i love burrito's...all kinds of burrito's. cheesy lamb filled

my mouth. i don't like cooking. what a waste of time. so if you
like cooking and eating you're the gal for me.<br />

now let me tell you what i hate. vegetarians and vegans that's
what. she might be the hottest thing since marilyn monroe on a cow
but if she won't put said cow in her mouth (after it is properly
cooked of course) then she can ride said cow into said
sunset.<br />

this tasty tasty food?? one word...murals. google that shit if you
don't know what it is...actually if you don't know stop reading
this immediately and find some yourself a joe shmoe because i ain't
no joe shmoe. so i paint murals. where do you need a mural? your
bedroom a public bathroom a church the inside of your dogs
house? no problem...i'll paint it. i went to school for zoo keeping

murals. what can i say...when muhammad gives you a gift you gotta

movies that neither you nor i have never heard of. so let's skip

beer and listen to really popular music that everyone knows. every

first time online so what else do you write? i have an amazing
family (two older siblings both married so i believe my mother is
now doing novena's hoping i meet the one). i have a terrific
friends from all over the world. an excellent professional network.
i tend to accomplish anything i set out to do. i make friends
easily love to laugh travel try new things avid reader which
has been frustrating as of late due to a lot of travel. i enjoy
almost any type of sports make sure i keep myself fit (but not
over the top on diet etc.) and i am equally content at a very
high-end event as i am in the local dive place just having a good i
conversation.<br />
<br />
i've dated people from all walks of life but only consider two of
my relationships very serious. the first took up most of my
thirties. the second carry me into the next decade. hard to believe
i am 43. i don't think i look it. certainly don't feel it. it's odd
to even write. however i didn't want to be one of those people who
lie about their age. it's just a number. i confess i spent a lot of
time focused on business. i've adjusted my life so that work is no
longer the priority it once was. at this point it would be nice to
have someone to share the adventure with.<br />
<br />
i figured i would give this a try and worse case make some new
friends and perhaps more. if you enjoy meeting new people having a
great conversation and a good laugh then feel free to contact me. i
am interested in a serious long-term relationship but i just have

<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />

<br />
i noticed that the questions here evolve around a few subjects so
i'll try to give my point of view on them:<br />
<br />
<strong>relationships -</strong> i'm not of the jealous type and i
am not attracted by ""very"" jealous men. i base all my relationships
on <em>trust</em> and <em>honesty</em>. i've been in exclusively
monogamous relationships and it worked well. i've flirted
polyamorously with multiple partners and it worked well. i've never
been in a long term open-relationship but it don't object to giving
it a try. so in terms of relationships i'm flexible enough. i feel
it is also something evolves as time passes.<br />
<br />
<strong>feelings -</strong> i'm an emotional person. it can be seen
as bad or scary by some but i don't think it is controllable. and
even if it was i don't think i'd want to. even when i've hooked
up with someone only once i liked to be connected and feel that we
were sharing just a little bit more than just sex (not that this
satisfied me completely). on the other hand i'm pretty independent
and i avoid having fusion partnerships (like couples unable to live
without one another). i fear being in that situation ... maybe is
it because i fear of getting too attached and then losing them. i
don't know. whatever.<br />
<br />
<strong>sex -</strong> just to clear things up. i don't think i
have any fetishism. not that i think it's a bad thing but i would
describe my sexuality as soft and gentle with some little rough
times. i'm up to try almost anything as long as it's consented and
in respect of the desires of both of us. i am versatile and have
been in relationships with experienced unexperienced versatiles
tops bottoms who practiced or not anal sex.<br />
<br />
<strong>religion/spirituality</strong>: i do not follow any
religion and i do not believe in any superior creating force. and
even if such force existed i don't think it would be fair from it
to ask us to worship it. though i have a spiritual side and i
believe that meditating on ourselves our lives and our surrounding
is good for what they call the soul.<br />
<br />
<strong>substance abuse -</strong> i smoke less than 10 cigarettes
per year! and i often steal them from friends when we're out
dancing. i'm not disgusted by smokers but i don't like kissing
smokers because it either tastes cigarettes or mint ... and it's
not what i'm after when i kiss. i enjoy drinking alcohol with
others but never alone. i rarely get drunk except when i have
reasons to forget something. i've never smoked marijuana never
taken hard drugs. i'm not against any but i'm fearful of how i
would react. i also don't like the smell of marijuana but maybe if
i'd smoke it i would say differently. so my position is that i'm
not against the use of drugs but i'm a little reluctant to try
them myself. i also would mind dating an addicted guy.<br />
<br />
<strong>politics -</strong> in france i lean strongly to the left
wing and i agree with some ideas of the extreme left. the us
equivalent is marginal (almost non-existent) so in that
dichotomized system i'd probably lean for the democrats. anyway
to make things clearer: if you are for the death penalty against
women rights (including abortion) for the freedom to bear arms
against social help ... we probably won't get along. but feel free
to contact me if you'd like to argue about it :)<br />
<br />
oh shit did it say summary at the top?!",1000000
"<strong>update: for the time being please no new messages from

overlook people who have already sent me messages.<br />

want. cause i probably won't initiate contact.<br />

speak of. i get along with ""strange"" people. i love love. i have a
wide array of sexual interests proclivities and fetishes. most of
them involve fetish clothing s/m and the like. i've identified as
submissive most of my life but have found recently i can enjoy the
hell out of topping as well. i find i prefer dogs to most people
and if you own a pitbull-and treat it well- we'll probably hit it
off. if i could do anything at this point in my life i'd open a
fetish/bdsm store and/or a pitbull rescue. i like smart girls. i

the wrong impression of myself up until february of this year i
was celibate for 2 years. it was an incredible learning experience
although i can't recommend it!<br />
<br />
i'm sure i'll get crap for this (especially in sf) but i like
girls who are the madonna out in public and mary magdolen behind
closed doors. no not terribly original from the perspective of a
guy but i don't need to get creative when looking for a date. so
far most everyone ok cupid says is a great match for me is
usually the opposite of the kind of girl i'd date. for starters
she would have already hated the number of times i've used the term
girl instead of woman! the first thing she'll want me to know is
that she's poly-amphibious? or something like that! ... last year
she had a tramp stamp and a bellybutton ring. this year she's got
both arms sleeved and wants you to call her josh from now on. she
can't cook and is proud of the fact. lastly sex is a political
statement and the sooner you face that... well you get the
picture.<br />
<br />
if you would describe yourself as the polar opposite to josh and
aren't afraid to be feminine please say hello! if you absolutely
love sf but even you get your fill of it from time to time?...
drop me a line.<br />
<br />
lastly the paragraphs i wrote below were intended to give you an
idea of my sense of humor but i think too many gir... women...
have taken it seriously and said ""whoa!"". there is some truth
hidden in there but the delivery is all firmly planted tongue in
cheek!<br />
<br />
why is it that any other time we love to talk about ourselves but
when it comes to filling out one of these ""profiles"" it feels like
tooth extraction??? seriously most people can't even stop thinking
about what they want to say next while the other person they're
talking to is speaking. but i'm sure i have your full attention...
right? um excuse me... hey ... girl! see what i mean?<br />
<br />
ok so i suppose i should start with what i'm looking for in a gal.
i think there was a time when i would have said ""nice"" or
""caring"". perhaps mention something about having a good sense of
humor... but today i think i'd simply say big boobs. and when i
say that i mean i am talking about really big knockers! i'm
talking having to be buried in a piano case when she dies big!
now before i get a lot of mean and nasty messages hear me out. i
am not a womanizer or shallow. it just so happens that this is
what i appreciate best in a woman. well that and a good sense of
humor. i am also a fan of small breasts... oh... and medium size
too.",1000000

that verse the last stanza of the queen by pablo neruda pretty
much defines why i'm here and what i'm looking for. having once
known that kind of love and having blown it i know how rare it
is. but if it happens i won't blow it a second time. i'm not here
for one of those plain vanilla low-conflict low-passion affairs.
my membership in okc is but one component of my search for someone
who will knock my sox off blow me away and shake me to my
foundation. that's a tall order. but as i wrote my okc search is
but one component. and i will not settle. most of all i would be
delighted to find someone with a very pronounced right brain.

<br />
that short verse from""but beautiful"" a jazz classic that has been
covered by every vocalist who matters pretty much summarizes where
i'm at in my life and in my quest. i have learned to open my heart
no matter what and be prepared to lose it all in order to win it
all.<br />
<br />
by the way some of you might remember my first incarnation on
okcupid as roiphe. that profile was roiphe 1.0; this profile is
roiphe 2.0 under the name of bobwhite1081. okc took roiphe 1.0
down because i flaunted the rules by using alias photos instead of
my own pics. i used james dean jon hamm cary grant humphrey
bogart peter sellers (as dr. strangelove) and alsace man with
corkscrew a ralph steadman painting among others. more than a few
busybodies (some of whom had no pictures at all on their own
profiles) ratted me out to okc. it happened one too many times and
okc took down my roiphe profile. so this time the pic you see on
this profile is a self-portrait of yours truly shot by yours
truly.<br />
<br />
i'm someone who lives fully in the senses. whatever i do i do with
passion. otherwise why bother? this isn't a dress rehearsal; it's
the real deal and our one and only shot. that's why i'm a foodie;
it's why i'm into wine; it's why i drive a ragtop. what's better
than the wind in your hair and the sun on your face? well actually
there are a few things better but that's a conversation we can have
when we meet. i'm into jazz in a big big way and attend quite a
few concerts presented by sfjazz the country's best jazz festival
if not the world's. i also have a rather large and growing
collection of jazz cds. i just bought ""the shearing piano"" a
george shearing cd with a version of ""stella by starlight"" that
will give you goosebumps. i also just acquired ""bennett sings
ellington"" by tony bennett. it has a version of ""prelude to a
kiss"" a song ( and arrangement) that displays vocal mastery that
only artists one can count on one hand possess. i listen to jazz
constantly at home and in my car. i'd do it at the office but
streaming music or video takes up too much of the company's network
bandwidth and i get nasty messages from it if i do it. maybe i'll
start taking cds to work with me. i dread the possibility that mp3
will become the standard format for music and am actively buying
cds while i still can before they too become museum pieces
alongside vinyl.<br />
<br />
i love to kiss and if i do say so myself i'm awfully good at it
as i've been told more than once. i love to stretch out on the sofa
with a mature (60-68) sexy woman and kiss for long stretches of
time. i love to kiss until i ache. i love the ache. by the way i'm
not looking for a younger woman. but i want to sincerely thank the
guys my age who are looking for a younger woman. they leave the
real women for me. as my father used to say there's no fool like
an old fool.<br />
<br />
i have lots of cool kitchen toys and know how to use them all. but
i also love to try new restaurants and new things to eat that i
haven't tried before. if one of them really knocks me out i try to
replicate it. for not having been professionally trained i'm one
of the better non-professional chefs around. but i make an unholy
mess in the kitchen when i'm cooking. as you probably know there
is a strong movement in the culinary world to use fresh locally
grown foods in the kitchen. this is a beautiful thing. but it's not
the only thing. without proper technique all you get is a bad meal
made from good stuff. technique is everything. by the way i hold
the secret to making perfect french fries. perfect is not an easy
trick but i know how to achieve it for french fries anyway.<br />
<br />
but the kitchen isn't the only room in which i have skills. i'm
handy in every room in the house. modest too you might have
noticed by now.<br />
<br />
besides being able to cook i know my way to the dry cleaners. i
know how to operate the vacuum and the washer and dryer. my
interest in finding a match has nothing to do with those
things.<br />
<br />
politically i'm a yellow dog which means that i'm about as
liberal as you can get. but i am no longer a democrat. i'm too
liberal for them. here's a quote from mark twain that seems
appropriate for the present times: in the beginning of a change
the patriot is a scarce man and brave and hated and scorned. when
his cause succeeds the timid join him for then it costs nothing
to be a patriot. clearly the real patriot is scarce; so scarce as
to be almost nowhere to be found despite the assertions of so many
who lay claim to the title. but they are hijackers claiming their
definition is the only true definition.<br />

when i was 3 or 4 i was blinded by <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=science"">science</a>. after watching my father start
the car with them i thought i could turn off the electricity in the
house by putting keys in the electrical outlet. i was right: i
tripped the circuit breakers.<br />

in spite of the darwinian nature of that example some people seem
to think i'm smarter than i actually am when really i'm just
perseverant. for instance i figured out how to remove the plastic
safety tab from that outlet which my parents put there to protect
me. draw your own conclusions.<br />

literal or simple; it's all the more amazing to me that we don't

one i currently have. most people just aren't that interested in
the technical details anyway so i rarely talk about it. there are
plenty of other things to talk about and do socially.<br />

<br />
note as of 2/12: welcome to my self summary. i'm actually not using
this site these days because i'm pursuing a committed relationship
with a wonderful man i met....here! good luck and have fun. okcupid
really works!<br />
<br />
so i had this really styling summary written on match.com then i
went to asia for 5 weeks and stopped checking my account then
returned to the us moved here to ca from my ""past life"" and now i
can't remember my match password! oh well i moved here to start a
new chapter in my life anyway so perhaps it's prophetic that i
lost my identity on the meat market of internet dating sites.<br />
not to say that i had a meat-only experience on match nor that i
object to fleshly tidbits and noshes. in fact i am experientially
omnivorous and meat of the match variety (eyebrow wiggling
included) is a highly appreciated part of my balanced diet. other
components include: time with my two vizslas; exploring the
wilderness (ideally on foot for days on end with an ultralight
backpack on my back); tennis; travel (especially to developing
equatorial places); reading (ideally with my head on someone's lap
or leg); doing health care; painting and photography. should i
mention crocheting? let me know if this made me sound too hermitish
and/or geriatric.<br />
not to get too woo-woo but my favorite thing in the world is
having a skill and being able to use it to help people. i find it a
blessing to be connected to other people in a meaningful way. and
we are all connected; it's up to us to determine the impact we'll
make. (ok that was a little summary of my religion ""other"" which
according to okcupid i take ""somewhat seriously."")<br />
things i have but am not really using even though i'd like to: 1.
guitar acoustic with joan baez song book artfully arranged
nearby. 2. my wesleyan university varsity crew sweatshirt which is
intended to psych me into getting back into rowing now that i live
in a state with water c. cookbooks many and varied. do i make the
time to cook? no i am a salad with hbe (hard boiled eggs)
specialist. i would love to be a foodie. i enjoy great food. my
brother and his wife are great cooks. perhaps perhaps this
chapter in my life will see me realize some other parts of my
potential.<br />
this part depends a bit on you and what you bring to the table.
ideally you are a person of integrity. you want to be part of the
solution. you have a job. you have baggage but you have insight and
peace about said luggage. you seek a committed relationship. you
value your family and you want a family of your own. you can laugh
at yourself and ask for directions if you're lost. (actually that
last bit about the directions isn't a deal-breaker if you don't
have it. sometimes you stumble on cool shit when you're lost. but
if you're not going to ask for directions you have to have a sense
of humor about the outcome!).<br />

i'm an sf native nerdy computer-using dude part-time
surfer/snowboarder/rock climber (fake rocks) and all-around
totally modest dude. i have a weird tan. i'm a bit of a coffee snob
(as you can probably tell by my username) and wish i did a lot more
traveling than i have so far.<br />
<br />
values-wise i'd say i'm a bit traditional and old-school and a bit
progressive in the typical and proper bay area way. fair warning
i'm a child of the internet. i also probably need a haircut at any

"hi! first of all if you know what gareth keenan is referring to i
love you.<br />
<br />
i'm in grad school at university of michigan. just finished my
first year! i'm drawn to the ocean and hope to eventually relocate
to a coast perhaps of another country. i love ethnic food coffee
visiting new places and ceaselessly analyzing everything around
me. i crave novel experiences intelligent people and dynamic
surroundings.<br />
<br />
sometimes i'm kind of like an old man. i like to wake up in the
morning read the financial times and drink coffee. paradoxically
it's extremely difficult for me to get up early but when i do i
find it very enjoyable.<br />
<br />
i'm very ambitious and competitive. also i probably love money and
power. but i temper it with my empathy for others so i'm not
completely soulless. i dwell on the future and love to find things
to look forward to.<br />
<br />
a few summers ago i worked for an airline got free flights and
traveled the world. i stayed in hostels which despite the stigma
eli roth gave it in hostel are by far the best way to travel.
they're cheap and you get to hang out with remarkably diverse
groups of really chill foreigners.<br />

<br />
graduated 2009 with a master's in sexuality studies. yes it was
fun and yes we talked about sex a lot and yes it means i'm good in
bed. i now have a job. groan! however it's a perfect challenge and
i love the way it's allowing me to grow and learn. i work in mental
health with homeless adults and young adults on the peninsula. the
system doesn't consider me a youth anymore so i'm a youth ally and
activist. i approach my work and life from a framework of
anti-oppression intersecting isms etc...<br />

drawing birds; spending time with my family and friends; going to

im a pretty personable i actively try to engage people in
conversations to see where they are coming from. i love random
adventures whether big or small. i am pretty silly ahem i mean i
do not take myself too serious and appreciate folks who are the
same.<br />
<br />
i just came back from a trip around southeast asia and lemme say
wow! freakin bee-you-tea-full! i loved being immersed in a
completely foreign culture. i felt like a toddler eyes wide open
mouth shut taking in all i could. it was humbling to say the
least. like looking at the stars and being reminded how minuscule
my world is (but a helluva lot more expensive). i know where i want
to be in life and how i would like to live. but beyond that i have
so much to learn in life in love in the world in
everything.<br />
<br />
i am being educated in hardcore physical sciences but it seems my
mind wonders back to the ""human condition"" (whatever the hell that
might be) and the ""way"" of things. not that i am particularly
politically active. but it seems like current thought is that
science (yes i meant the capital s) is the new great hope for all
of human kinds ills but i dont think it is. it also seems im not
the only one that thinks the world is effed up.<br />
<br />
my eyes have been opened to completely new perspectives and
insights simply by meeting random peoples. and some of my most
profound and perspective shifting conversations have been with
complete strangers. this is why i consider myself a growing
adult-ish person because i know my growth is constant and
continual. my natural disposition is an open mind but this
disposition has been reinforced due to these experiences. i enjoy
hearing the stories and lives of others. i feel another's story can
possibly help me grow and if not meh i enjoy getting to know
folks too.",1000000

"i always have a travel bag packed and ready to go. i crave
adventure and spontaneity. life was meant to be lived and that is
my biggest philosophy. my ""just do it"" attitude turns a lot of
people off. i make completely irrational decisions in split
seconds. i always figure ""why not?!""-- what have i got to lose?
i'm brutally honest and constantly questioning.<br />
<br />
seemingly high maintenance but surprisingly low key. i've been
told by many that i am without a doubt the most confusing person
they have ever met. often misunderstood and misinterpreted i tend
to catch people off guard. i'm a simple complex a paradox of all
means.<br />
<br />
i have three passions in life: food fashion and (crab) fishing.
seriously. self proclaimed food snob--- if you think you can join
me on my quest to eat through this city bring it! i have an
aversion to okra bittermelon and peas. i am an aficionado of
bacon cheese and fresh bread.<br />
<br />
i'm slowly eating my way throughout the us. it is my goal to visit
all 50 states this year and it would be quite lovely to have a
local specialty in every state! send your restaurant
recommendations my way! currently: looking for the best pizza in
brooklyn ny. or just ny in general. i already found the cheesecake
place that stole my heart.<br />
<br />
my one wish in life is to see the entire world.. and that's what
i'm doing one day at a time. i'm kind of looking for friends that
are crazy enough to meet me in random places. deep dish in chicago?
tacos in cancun? coffee in seattle? are you crazy enough?<br />

any means. i am simply looking to meet new people and expand my

---which profile do you want? there's my intellectual/philosophical
side my geek/dweeb/nerd side my bohemian/hippie side. i don't
know which one is the real me! according to the results here it's
the goth/freak side i would have thought the philosophical
one.<br />
<br />
most important for you to know about me is that i do not have
social skills. i say this in all honesty because i was a loner
growing up and i'm still figuring out things now that most people
knew by heart when they were 15. srsly. also i tend to deal with
things as how they should be or how i'd like them to be rather
than as they actually are. so if i jump in head first with both
feet with you don't be scared i'm just anticipating. i'm in love
with the concept of you. loving you will come or not over
time.<br />
<br />
--now i'm supposed to make this 1000 words? ok let's break down
all those different facet things.<br />
<br />
a) intellectual/philosophical/political. this is where i live. i am
a libertarian socialist notice which is the root but to me each
term is a bit more generic than is generally understood. simply
put everyone's basic need should be guaranteed (yes regardless of
anything) following which the government should be efficient
transparent and laissez-faire. or to put it another way do your
job then leave me alone. only a meritocracy of intellectuals has
the capacity to be a proper leadership for the world so take your
objections to intellectual oligarchy and shove 'em where the sun
don't shine. democracy is an evil. rule by might not right.
whoever has the biggest opinion gets their way instead of whoever
has the best opinion. not only that but there will always be some
small minority which is completely disenfranchised just because
they happen to never be in the majority. how can any government be
valid when someone whose opinions are just as likely right as
anyone else's never gets their way? that's another thing all
opinions are not equal. one is better than another based on how
well it meshes with objective reality. and yes there is an
objective reality or at least if there isn't there's nothing else
to talk about particularly ethics politics or philosophy.
backing up... although you have every right to your basic survival
as a default just from having been born (because we're not animals
and that sort of naturalism is directly contrary to our societal
evolution and individual sentient autonomy) you can lose that. life
has no inherent value. that value must be added. the default is
only a baseline. if you try to do good things don't take more than
your share and generally make the world a better place you
deserve all life has to offer. if you don't you shouldn't be on
this planet taking up space and resources needed by those who are
you are a weed which needs to be plucked. if you don't know what
i'm talking about start with ""i think therefore i am"" and ""know
thyself"" and i'll meet you on the other side.<br />
<br />
b) geek/dweeb/nerd. i don't lay equal claim on those but until the
technical social pariah crowd gets together to determine their
actual definitions i'll just hedge my bets. i'm not as into
manga/comics etc as most of this ilk i'm not as into anything i
guess as most people who lay claim to these monikers but as in most
other aspects of my life i am a generalist. i know a little bit
about it all not much about anything. i appreciate all of it.
despite having been interested in some aspect or another my whole
life it's never been my scene so maybe i'm just a legacy now
without ever having graduated. or maybe i just fit in because i'm
an outcast lol.<br />
<br />
c) bohemian/hippie. to me this says coffee shop culture. but then
that's so varied isn't it. in pulp fiction they call something like
a denny's a coffee shop. i never would. the shop that they hang out
in in friends seems to qualify (barely) but the conversation is
mundane. it should be profound arcane or sublime. where's the
art? where're the deep nooks for intimate connection and
reflection? philosophy lives there it's the new forum. rainbow
gatherings are planned as are gunpowder plots. constitutions and
manifestos are written personalities meld and shatter words flow
and drip oozing from psychic pores. yes poetry is written too
lines are drawn souls collide. whatever. it's the hive of the
mind.<br />
<br />
d) goth/freak. i'm an original vicgoth. if you don't know what that
means well you're probably not a goth you're a poseur. being
goth isn't about the music it's about joyous melancholy. whatever
music helps you reach that place is suitable. and goth is not emo
although it used to be far closer. above all goth is not heavy
metal and hot topic. those are tools they are not representative
of the whole and they are not the deep focused angst of a true
goth however much cutting you do there. --as a freak generally
freaks generally are my people. i embrace the pariah i love the
culturally downtrodden. i am part of the out crowd and i love it
there. my opinions are incompatible with the status quo and aside
from philosophy in which i am a god and the normals are sheep our
thoughts and opinions are what maintain diversity and prevent the
grey nation syndrome. we are those for whom the constitution was
written to protect. we are those for whom freedom of speech is the
primary enabler not a nice side-effect. freaks are the joy and
wonder of the world. we're here we're queer get used to it.",1000000

questions all seem to come down to ""will you cheat on me"" to which
i will simply answer no and save you and me the time of
reading/answering a million questions trying to trick one of us
into answering yes. the other half are simplistic and black and
white- i don't like people because they smile when they see babies
or because of how often they brush their teeth or whether they
could date a messy person or not. who cares. i like people for all
the things that you could never ask in a multiple choice question.
the indescribable things that can't be put to words but you feel
when you see that person walking talking looking at you existing
in the world the way they do. the moments between all the
meaningless questions.<br />

but i like the idea of opening up to the great unknown possibility
that this website presents reaching out to people outside of those
i meet in everyday life. there's so many rad people out there that
you won't run into at work or in class or at the supermarket
between the apples and kiwis (or who you do see but don't wind up
talking to). it's cool to think that this profile is always up and
who knows who might come along. who's out there?!!<br />

people but it's a bit like barbie-ville. i like being in new york
for periods of time as long as i have an exit plan but i don't
think i could live there. i've traveled a lot throughout my life
to all 50 states mexico central america ecuador galapagos
india jamaica. i'd like to go to europe and japan. i'm not a
sight-seeing traveler i'm more interested in the back roads and
the little things and i like staying places a little while to get

good too. i never saw the taj mahal when i was in india and have no
regrets.<br />

i have a lot of creative energy and i've always had creative
projects in my life. when i was a kid i had a double room separated

most of the closet as well. i'm in love with photography and video
and have been since high school so that gets most of my creative
attention but i generally just like making things. i want art to
happen in everyday life and not in galleries. i have lots of
aspirations and dreams enough for several lifetimes. i don't
really understand how people can be uninterested or not know what
they want to do with their lives. i'd like to make art music
study science politics religion be an airplane pilot or maybe
helicopter or race car driver a surfer bum... i'll always be
thinking about what i want to be when i grow up.<br />

i continue working on my art in my studio and regularly participate
in open studios as well as some group shows here &amp; there. i'm
pretty busy with my hands (textile artist) and can relate to that
quote ""idle hands are the devil's playground"" or something to that
effect.<br />
<br />
i may live next door but i am far from being the girl next door. i
pretty much march to the beat of my own drum. i'm that funky-down
to earth-crafty girl - kinda quirky. in fact the guys that hang out
on 26th st btwn folsom &amp; harrison call me ""punky brewster"" when
i ride my bicycle past them. i have appropriated my fashion sense
from my kids in my class &amp; am not big on the whole make-up
thing. i'm often found in converse.<br />
<br />
i'm a bicycler &amp; commute to work daily on my faithful
""margorie."" i pretty much get around via bicycle. there is nothing
like being on a bicycle daily.<br />

"i suppose you could say i live a rather exceptional life. i have
worked full time as an entertainer for almost five years now and
continue to watch my life grow in ways i hadn't forseen. the best
part of this is i don't have a boss and i make my own
schedule.<br />
traveling is a major part of my lifestyle. passing through places
on the in between byways gives me a special thrill. the dusty towns
on the way to nowhere. its even better if i'm booked on a show
there. poetry aside traveling has given me a sense of belonging to
the world and having a place in it. however i now have a subtle
feeling that i would like to slow down a bit and begin exploring
other aspects of life. places where most people are meaning less
travel knowing faces at the coffee shop feeling like i'm not a
stranger in my own apartment having friends that i see on a
regular basis.<br />
despite the 100000 miles i have put on my cari'm quite stable
financially and emotionally. in many respects. i'm not given to
defeatism working hard is a pleasure and i make a point to be
respectful honest and helpful.<br />
<br />
there is a part of me that is something like an artist on off
switch. a healthy balance of the inner vs outer worlds for myself
has come through letting my inner redneck out. yes i grew up in
southern oregon where driving trucks and atv's was not too
uncommon. not to worry though i was more on the
sustainability/domehouse/solar panel side and less on the chewing
tobacco/guns/gasoline bonfires side of back country small town
living. all i'm saying is i like the woods the desert the
mountains the ocean i go an annual camping trip to spots in death
valley with some friends and i recently went ski touring with all
our gear packed on tow sleds. i was in the boy scouts and spent a
chunk of my child hood in costa rica too so i am quite familiar
with getting dirty and loving it. lots of times i'll forego a
hotel just go up to a lake and camp out. i'm a big fan of driving
into the national forest and finding places i've never been.
recently drove 100 miles on a dirt road in northern nevada. sent
out a few texts letting people know where i was headed before hand
just in case. i studied wilderness leadership spanish french and
german in college only to end upworking as a
comedian/juggler/writer. how bout dat. great stars out there.<br />

and to have sympathy with you and to try to have something in

math and science but after spending so much time on the internet
i learned that it is hard for women to find a man who is not a

that isn't my personal taste. i rather talk about poetry politics

i dream big. i have an optimistic outlook on life. i'm there for my

ok a lil' about me: polish refugee who was exiled from his own
country due to my father fighting communism back then. the story
goes on anyways i made it to sf when i was 3 years of age. here i
am. i love life everyone and everything. i'm very conscious
conscientious and spiritual. i like to dance and play music. i
love animals and they love me :d true story. i'm a very nice guy
who is sensitive to the world but at the same time has incredibly
tough skin.<br />
i'm not a fighter but a lover. a hopeless romantic really.
currently thinking about trying the polyamorous life. i have no
partners right now and am just dating. i'm not the player type and
if i'm flirting i'm probably not doing it on purpose lol. i
recently cut my hair :( but i had to. i'm employed and work at a
fancy bar downtown for the time being. i will be in school for the
next 4-5 years. i won't stop until i have my masters degree in
green business.<br />
<br />
i'm also interning at the eco center off of 3rd st. it's the only
off grid center in sf. i'm in head of the solar pv and energy
systems. we collect rainwater in three 500 gallon drums..we filter
the public restrooms poop and pee toilet water through these above
ground septic tanks which then get hit by a uv filter from the sun
to kill the pathogens..and the the water trickles down to the
snails and fishies who help clean the water through an artificially
made wetland (pebbles and marsh grasses) which cleans the water to
almost pottable standards. then the water gets pumped underground
and into the butterfly field i've been working on. our neighbors
bay natives donated over 6000 native plants to us. people will not
be allowed in the butterfly garden but i will have access since i
helped build it. i can't wait to take a girl on a date to the
butterfly garden. it's going to be amazing! and the eco center has
a living roof planted with natives. it's a full circle loop. cradle
to cradle rather than cradle to grave.<br />
the place is awesome and we are always looking for more volunteers
every week.<br />

i'm also a really good house dj. (seriously) dj dom aka king
dom<br />

am king of my domain. also in latin i.e. kingdom domain.. in

so far. some of the most enjoyable evenings i spent at cobb's
comedy club crying from laughing listening jazz while having a
glass of red wine at yoshi's club or ice skating on union square

museums in the city. love abstract art because it's open to
interpretation and analysis. i definitely would love to explore new
adventures and activities(surfing in the rain roller blading
golf tennis cooking....you name it) with interesting people. i

you want to know where i'm going.<br />

in my life right now i have decided to do a lot of the things i
have always wanted. 2012 is a banner bucket list year for me. i
have a great job that i love and i can travel wherever i want
because i work on the internet. ok get your mind out of the gutter;
i don't actually make a living from my webcam strip showyet. i'm a

i use ""...."" way too much. in fact now that i've gotten that off
my chest maybe i should start throwing them in now.<br />

i like spicy food...and super-scrabble...not necessarily together.
i think intelligence is very sexy. i love movies. i'm just a little
eccentric (yeah just the right amount to keep people on their
toes).<br />

i'm great with my hands i believe there is good in everyone and i

so why san francisco? i spent a half day there christmas 2008 on an
amazing whirlwind 2-week trip from nc to ca and backand i fell in
love and vowed to return someday for a slightly longer stay (to
confirm that it is the most amazing city ever and that i will be
living there permanently...eventually). i have a couple of
acquaintances in the bay area but no one i would seriously want to
hang out with extensively or have as my unofficial tour guide.
hint!! hint!!<br />
<br />
why am i here?.......simply to connect with cool interesting
people that i might not meet otherwise.<br />
<br />
however if you are anything resembling flaky or
superficial....please keep it moving.....i simply don't find that
attractive and rather surround myself with people who have a little
substance.<br />

just a few of my observations on okc so far.<br />
1) in general i think contradictions can be intriguing but some
simply are not..for example i enjoy a night out on the town but
i'm also comfortable staying in. who doesnt!!<br />
2) okc should filter out the people who have not been online in 3
months from the searches. it's quite useless for them to appear on
the list. that's search results paddingopen and shut case.<br />
3) most women who say they have a great sense of humor have
absolutely nothing even remotely funny anywhere on their profile.
what gives!!<br />
4) pictures that are so small that they are squeezed up into the
corner of the picture window should never be approved.",1000000

<br />
i currently identify as genderqueer and more specifically as an
agender fag. i feel some deep resonances with queer male
performativities and with the reclamation of femme presentations
that is going on in queer male communities nowadays. and
considering how i was derogated as a fag for most of my life i
feel like i can reclaim that term as central to my queer self. i
also think that ""fag"" can designate something more about gender
presentation and how that has been historically central to queer
experiences. i'm actually deeply saddened by how ""gay"" has come to
mean ""gender normative man or woman interested in members of the
same sex."" the binarism and lack of reflection regarding social
constructions of ""sex"" really frustrate me as well as the gender
normativity bit.<br />
<br />
so yes agender fag. and my preferred pronouns are xe hir
hirs.<br />
<br />
with that out of the way i'm also a kinky polyamorous switchy
witchy anarchist sci fi nerd. i'm happy to discuss any and all of
those identifications with folks. i could also be feasibly tricked
into a monogamish relationship. though i don't see that happening
any time soon. i'm honestly just trying to start a colony of queer
weirdos who all fuck together on weekends.<br />
<br />
i'm also super committed to social justice. i do my best to reflect
on my positions of privilege and to educate myself around that
while holding myself and others accountable for casual acts of
cissexism racism sexism heterosexism binarism fatphobia
able-ism and so forth. as always that is a work in progress and
i'm definitely open to criticism.<br />

i have the most sexual experience with people who identify as
male-spectrum (this obviously includes trans men but it's good to
be clear) but i'm certainly open to genderqueers and other folks
(i.e. women). i'm still not very sure what i'm interested in when
it comes to folks who identify away from male identifications but

that.",1000000

gonna have my own sauna. if that doesn't interest you we have
irreconcilable differences.<br />
<br />
i'll live in or have a little cabin in a scenic (or at least
natural) place which could be any variety - forest forest by a
lake open plains mountains desert farmland - and i'll have a
sauna not attached to my house where i'll steam at night. it'll
be all wood and have a room attached to it like all the finns and
russians have where you can sit and drink beer and play cards or
whatever - nothing electronic except maybe lighting - and a small
porch outside with a bench and a shower head to rinse. inside the
sauna itself it'll be a wood-burning stove with rocks that you
can pour water over. and at night especially in the winter and
especially if there's snow it'll be the warmest coziest place
ever inside but you can go out and drench yourself in freezing
shower water or roll in the snow and then back in and repeat all
night. and i'll sit outside looking at my surrounding scenery
with steam coming off my skin and by the time i take a last shower
and go back home i'll be in a state of total bliss. every
night.<br />

i've got a wide range of interests and hobbies generally speaking

i'm sticking with it and enjoying it 75% of the time.<br />

there is no self then how can there be a self summary?<br />

buddhists believe ""there is no permanent or static entity that
remains constant behind the changing bodily and non-bodily
components of a living being"".<br />
<br />
that makes me wonder... if someone were a buddhist would they say
""i am a buddhist""? which would indicate the existence of a self. or
would they say something like ""the dynamic entity behind my
changing bodily and non-bodily components is a buddhist at the
present moment""?<br />

are<br />

husky that lays around all day but then goes for a

much as i should but genetics has seemed to have mostly taken

dinner<br />

be<br />
more than that. i'm not ruling out marriage but it would

"since this is the first thing you see lets cover the basics.<br />
<br />
why on earth would you want to message me as soon as you can?<br />
<br />
well first of all because there's only one of me and so many
people out there and i do have a limited amount of hours per day
days per year and years in my life. that makes me a hot commodity
because i get booked fast.<br />
now before you dismiss me as someone that's full of themselves let
me clarify i don't necessarily get booked by people desperate to
meet me or that adore me. my main talent is talking to people and
most of my friends are true friends and do talk to me about
anything and everything. so a lot of the times i spend the hours
that i'm not working or at school talking to my friends helping
them solve issues.<br />
that bring me to my next point talking i do suggest if you happen
to visit my profile send me a message and tell me what you are
interested in because chances are i can connect you with what you
need to succeed and honestly i don't care if you are a girl a guy
or anything else because fact of the matter is i'm not here to
find my soulmate i'm not here to find someone i'm going to have
hot sex with. i'm here too provide myself for another method of
meeting people.<br />
next point when i say another method of meeting people i say that
honestly because i have no issue walking up to someone on the
street starting a conversation with them and perhaps even becoming
friends. i have an open mind and i don't care what you like who you
like if you have a pet alligator or anything because i enjoy all
types of personalities and perspectives on life.<br />
one thing i do hate though is dishonesty if you can not be honest
with me we will have issues and i do suggest you not message me
for your own good. i value my friends and my own honor and while
you can call it an outdated ideology i will passionately defend
myself and those i care about against anything i deem dangerous.
dishonest people = danger so don't mess with me end of
story.<br />
drama i hate drama if you want to talk to me about it go ahead
we can figure out a way to solve it and to end it but if you are
going to come and try starting drama i warn you you won't enjoy
the outcome.<br />
<br />
on a happy note if any of you do talk to me and decide to meet up
for coffee i do have a warning for you. i can make almost any day
seem amazing. i can blow your mind with scenery and conversation i
can make everything seem funny and your troubles to fade away for
the duration of our conversation. the warning is that after us
hanging out you will have to return to reality until our next
meeting and some people don't enjoy the path back to reality so i
warn you ahead of time if you want to stay grounded in reality and
find some boring guy to bore you to death stay away from me
because i'm not him.<br />

above:<br />

<b>hey ""girl"".</b><br />
<br />
do you know why roller pigeons roll?<br />
<i><strong>because what is essential is invisible to the
eye.</strong></i><br />
<br />
why should you speak to me?<br />
<br />
i'm supposed to know; i'm supposed to sell you on it.<br />
<br />
i'm the john galt of your desire; set me free.<br />
<br />
no really <i>why should you speak to me?</i><br />
<br />
you really shouldn't; that's why you should.<br />
<br />
i'll be your huckleberry; the butler you fire for gossiping; your
private idaho; your personal jesus.<br />
<br />
we don't have to give a single fuck about an oxford comma because
don't have to fear the protean instability of the english language;
together we won't be gullible even though they lied to us the
whole time; we won't imitate the idiotic and tragically successful
behaviors of the other members of our species; we'll invent our own
pidgin dialect and meet in secret like the chinese tongs and the
bavarian illuminati; we'll practice clever handshakes.<br />
<br />
we can do all this it's easy; i can show you how; they say the
orphans raised by foxes know where to find wells in the sahara; the
nomads hire them as guides; i was raised by criminals on the
internet; it's kind of the same principle.<br />
<br />
i don't know who you are but i know you're hiding from all these
judging eyes; i might think you're awesome for reasons you never
even imagined and may never understand; the universe might not
contain unconditional love but it does contain inexplicable love
and i'm the messiah of inexplicable.<br />
<br />
there's really nothing to fear by reaching out past the adipose of
syntagmatic conformity deep into the ineffable incision of words
on the screen where the traces of the beating author lie coiled
like a sleeping basilisk. because i don't want to judge you; i just
want to dance. just dance without pretensions.<br />
<br />
you just gotta dance.<br />

american life. listening to npr is sexy in the same way as reading
the new york times is sexy. i listen to this american life at night

"winter olympics 1992- was part of the first jamaican bobsled team:
growing up in jamaica as a young man i became a world-class
sprinter destined to win the summer games like my father but was
tripped up in the final trials by the runners next to me.
devastated but determined to make it to the olympics any way i
could i teamed up with coach john candy and trained with the
people who tripped me. incredibly we trained hard and with our
""can-do"" spirit we made it to calgary where all the canadians were
racist but by being ourselves and sticking together we proved to
the world that jamaica could compete in ways it never had before
and discovered ourselves in the process. jimmy cliff himself sang
at the end of our journey and i lost my jamaican accent.",1000000

"you know the commute from the city to san jose? i take the scenic
route via 280 even though it's way longer. no not only because
it's a more scenic drive. it's actually the perfect length to let
an entire album play through without cutting short.<br />
<br />
quite the fan of spontaneous vacations and roadtrips i use any
excuse to get out of the house. on those lazy sunny afternoons i'm
much more at home going for a bike ride around crissy field or
lounging at a music festival or golden gate/dolores park with an
ipa a frisbee or game of bags and the company of my friends.
winter there's no place i'd rather be than snowboarding in tahoe.
summer is all about beach bonfires and camping trips amongst the
redwoods.<br />

my highlights of 2011 were traveling around argentina and brazil
running the warrior dash and competing in my first powerlifting
meet. for 2012 i'm pumped to crowdsurf at coachella (done!)
